Now go into the code of this auth-app:\ncd authorization_code\nThere are 2 things inside, the app.js is the main code of the application, folder public contains a html file.\nInside app.js there are 3 things you should care about:\n\nclient_id: Client Id of your app. (After create a new app as above, in the dashboard)\nclient_secret: Client Secret of your app.\nredirect_uri: the url we will redirect after authenticating successfully.\n\nThe port of server is set to be 8888, so I will set redirect_uri base on it:\nvar redirect_uri = 'http://localhost:8888/callback/';\nYou also need to whitelist your redirect_uri in the settings of your app.\n\n\n\nWhitelist redirect URI\n\n\nNow go to http://localhost:8888 and follow all steps to login and you should be redirect to this after successfully login.\n\n\n\nLogin success"

    "text": "Working with playlists\nNow it’s the fun part. How can I retrieve data of playlists I need?\nAfter reading the documents, I have a brief understand about what I can do with this api.\nThere are 3 ways to get info about playlists:\n\nUsing API /v1/users/{user_id}/playlists to acquire playlists of a specific user_id\nUsing API /v1/search to search and return playlists with a specific query keyword\nUsing API /v1/browse/categories/{category_id}/playlists to retrieve playlists from a specific category\n\nI want to use the third method, because the playlists I’m interested in should be distinguished by category instead of user, or query keywords.\nThere are many categories in spotify, and each category contains many playlists, each playlist has many tracks too. But I don’t want to get all playlists from each category, so I don’t have to call too many apis.\nThe expected output is something like this — for each category, I retrieve 5 playlists, and for each playlist, I want all tracks with its name, singer, and other data:\n[\n  {\n    \"category\": \"A\",\n    \"playlists\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"First playlist\",\n        \"tracks\": [\n          {\n            \"track_name\": \"Song 1\",\n            \"singer\": \"B\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nTo be able to manipulate data conveniently, I would like to save category, playlists, and tracks in database.\nI’ll use mongodb because it’s the most familiar database to me. You can use any of these.\nFirst, copy the access token in the login page above and assign it to new variable in app.js:\nvar acc_token = '&lt;your access token&gt;'\nThen install mongoose package:\nnpm install mongoose\nMongoose is a mongodb object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment or in this case, nodejs. Add mongoose:\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\n// Connect mongoose to our database named spotify.\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1/spotify', {useNewUrlParser: true});\n// useNewUrlParser to fix a DeprecationWarning\n\n// Declare schema\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;"

I can call it Category_Detail model. The advantage is whenever I want to retrieve data from db, I only have to access one model, no need to use reference fields.\nThe disadvantage is, as I considered, bigger because I will need to store my playlists in each Category_Detail as an array which makes thing hard to update, and with each playlist I need another array for tracks, so 2 nested arrays are too complicated for a model like this.\nThus, I decide to use the second way to design my model — 3 seperated models as following category, playlist and track. Playlist will contains 1 reference field that refers to category, and track will contains 1 reference field refers to playlist that it belongs to.\nconst CategorySchema = new Schema({\n  cat_name: String,\n  cat_id: String,\n});\nconst Category = mongoose.model('Category', CategorySchema);\n\nconst PlaylistSchema = new Schema({\n  category: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category'},\n  playlist_name: String,\n  playlist_id: String,\n});\nconst Playlist = mongoose.model('Playlist', PlaylistSchema);\n\nconst TrackSchema = new Schema({\n  playlist: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Playlist'},\n  track_name: String,\n  track_id: String,\n  artists: Array,\n  images: Array,\n  playlist_name: String,  // This field for convenient data analysis later\n  playlist_id: String,    // This field for convenient data analysis later\n});\nconst Track = mongoose.model('Track', TrackSchema);"

Normally we’ll search one by one from left to right of the list: 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 6. We found it, but if the list has thousands of items, it would take a lot of time to do the search operation like that.\nAlternatively, we can use a binary search tree data structure to improve the speed. We basically arrange the order of the items in the list with the rule:\n\nEach item is stored in a node\nEach node (item) may have left and right child with the condition: left child &lt; item &lt; right child\n\n\n\n\nBinary Search Tree\n\n\nWith that logic, we don’t have to go through all items to find the number we want.\nStart from root (top item). If we want number 6, we compare it with the root node. 6 &lt; 7 so we go to the left branch (because smaller items are always stored to the left of the parent item). We get number 4 and because 6 &gt; 4 we go to the right of 4.\nThe time to search/find an item only depends on the height of the tree, which is the longest path from root node to any leaf node (other items) in the tree. The bigger the height, the slower the speed to find the item we want.\n\n\n\nTree Height"

In this case, smaller means it comes before in the alphabet.\n\n\n\nIndex B-tree Structure\n\n\nWhen we search for a name like Yehuda Katz, we start from the root. Y is bigger than P in Paul Bakaus so we look up the right node of Paul Bakaus.\nIn the child node, we do the same thing until we reach the lowest child node. In this lowest node, we do binary search to search the value. The number of values stored in each node is small, so binary search will do the search really fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy We Use B-tree\n\n\n\n\nWe can store data in each node instead of only 1 in a balanced tree, therefore reducing the height of the tree and improving the speed of the search.\nValues in each node are sorted in a particular order, therefore we can look up faster. The number of values in each node is small enough so binary search can be quick too."

    "text": "Rules for SQL Optimization\nThanks to understanding the underlying principle of indexes, we can now note down some rules for better queries in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe notes below will be updated regularly.\n\n\n\n1. Avoid LIKE with Leading Wildcards\nAvoid LIKE expressions with leading wildcards (e.g., '%TERM').\nBecause the index uses the first letter and sorts by A-Z order, we should avoid LIKE expressions without the first letter specified. The index table will be useless in this case.\n\n\n2. Multi-Column Index Rules\nIf we create an index for multiple columns, then the WHERE condition applied for only one of those columns will not use the index.\nFor example, if we make an index for user_id and company, then searching for user_id = 1000 alone will not use the index. The index is only valid for the combination of user_id and company. We have to search for user_id = 1000 AND company = 'GOOGLE' to use the index.\n\n\n3. Case-Insensitive Indexes\nIf we want to search with Case-Insensitive matching (meaning CUONG and Cuong return the same result), then we should create an index with case-insensitivity:\nCREATE INDEX user_index ON users (UPPER(first_name));\nThis creates an index with uppercase of first_name column values. Then we execute the query:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE UPPER(first_name) = 'CUONG';\n\n\n4. Function-Based Index Considerations\nIf you want to query data like “how many days from the latest day each user bought a product”, you might write something like TRUNC(DAYS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, buy_date)).\nHowever, this value cannot be indexed because it changes daily. (Index can be updated with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands, but can’t automatically update daily or when executing SELECT commands).\nSolution: Index buy_date instead. If we want to query all users that have 30 days from now to their latest purchase, we calculate that date (that_date = today - 30 days), then query with condition that_date = buy_date.\n\n\n5. DateTime Range Conditions\nWhen writing conditions for datetime ranges, explicitly declare the start and end of the time range.\nInstead of:\nWHERE date_time &lt; '2020-10-10'\nWrite:\nWHERE date_time &gt; '2020-10-09' AND date_time &lt; '2020-10-10'"

Như vậy ta có thể tính trong 100 khách hàng mở app, có bao nhiêu người sẽ đi đến bước thêm vào giỏ hàng.\n\\[\\text{CR từ A đến B} = \\frac{\\text{số người ở bước B}}{\\text{số người ở bước A}}\\]\nĐể biết được bạn cần tính CR cho bước A nào, B nào, bạn cần xác định rõ user flow của mình.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nNếu mô hình của bạn tập trung vào acquisition, có thể bạn sẽ chấp nhận 1 mức CR thấp hơn 1 mô hình tập trung vào loyalty.\nVới acquisition, bạn thậm chí sẽ tập trung vào CR của các kênh marketing hơn là CR của luồng người dùng sử dụng trên web/app của bạn."

You do marketing, invite people to use your app, but after a while you realise the number of active users is decreasing.\nHow can that happen when you regularly promote and acquire new users to your app?\nTo answer that question, we need to know:\nCohort analysis is created to answer those questions.

Similarly, on Jan 26, there were another 1,358 new users who signed up.\nThe triangle heat map shows us how those user groups behave. In the first row, the group of 1,098 users who registered on Jan 25 stopped using the app the next day (Jan 26) dramatically — dropping by 66.1% and remaining at only 33.9%. The following day, it got worse when only 23.5% of those 1,098 users were still using the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey Insight\n\n\n\nThanks to the heat map, we can see that after the first day of registration, most groups of users are leaving the app. This answers the question of when our customers leave our platform.\nThe next question is: how do we investigate that first day of using the app to define why they stop using it?"

    "text": "Phân tích bài toán\nGiả sử, bạn đang là cô-founder (hoặc chú-founder) của 1 start-up nào đó. Sản phẩm của bạn tốt nhưng bạn muốn cải thiện UI-UX của nó để nó có thể tốt hơn.\nMuốn làm cho sản phẩm tốt hơn, thì bạn phải biết nó đang không tốt ở chỗ nào đã.\nĐể cho cụ thể, mình sẽ thử phân tích 1 phần UI/UX trang homepage của Lazada. Các phân tích phía sau đều là giả thuyết và mang tính minh hoạ cho ý tưởng.\n\n1. Từ dữ liệu xác định chỉ số cần cải thiện (xác định mục tiêu)\nTrong trang homepage có rất nhiều phần/section khác nhau, và mình sẽ thử tính toán số liệu ở section đầu tiên — cái banner ở homepage này.\n\n\n\nBanner homepage Lazada\n\n\nGiả sử, bạn vào trong data warehouse của công ty và query ra 2 thông số là lượt view banner và lượt click banner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsection\nview_count\nclick_count\nclick_rate (click_count / view_count)\n\n\n\n\nbanner\n150,000\n750\n0.5%\n\n\n\nTất nhiên, số kia mình bịa ra nên nó hơi cực đoan 1 chút. Ta biết CTR của 1 banner quảng cáo dạng slider là khoảng 1% (mình lấy số từ 1 nghiên cứu của đại học Notre Dame — Link tại đây, số này cũng chỉ mang tính tham khảo vì mình không biết số phù hợp trong trường hợp này).\nVì vậy, tỷ lệ click 0.5% ở trên là thấp và do đó mục tiêu là cần tìm cách sửa banner để cải thiện click rate của banner.\n\n\n2. Dựa vào kinh nghiệm cá nhân hoặc Heuristic Evaluation để xác định vấn đề\nGiờ thì ta cần phân tích xem cái banner đang có vấn đề gì.\nTheo mình thì banner đã được:\n\nThiết kế đẹp\nMàu sắc hài hoà\nNội dung liên quan đến dịp trung thu sắp tới\nKhuyến mãi cũng rõ ràng\n\nTuy nhiên có 1 phần mà tớ cảm thấy hơi có vấn đề là nút CTA (Call-to-Action) Mua Ngay.\nLiệu nút CTA có nên đặt ở phần giữa phía dưới (bottom-center) của banner sẽ ổn hơn; hay là ngay dưới dòng khuyến mãi “Sắp sửa chơi trăng” (bottom-left) và chuyển cái hashtag sang bên phải — vì mình cảm thấy người dùng sẽ dễ click vào CTA hơn nếu nó ở giữa hoặc ở ngay phía bên trái (do mắt người sẽ đọc từ trái sang phải); hoặc là chả cần cái nút này nữa.\n\n\n\nPhân tích vị trí CTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSau tất cả, đó chỉ là suy đoán cảm tính của mình, và mình cần 1 căn cứ đáng tin cậy hơn để quyết định vị trí đặt CTA.\n\n\n\n\n3. Thử nghiệm\nNhư vậy, mình đã đưa ra 1 số phán đoán và giờ mình cần thử nghiệm để xem phán đoán nào chính xác. Mình sẽ thử nghiệm với 2 vị trí CTA là bottom-left và bottom-right (những giải pháp khác cũng làm tương tự).\nMình chọn mẫu người dùng với số lượng 10,000 người dùng cho mỗi vị trí:\n\nNhóm A: 10,000 người dùng ngẫu nhiên và banner homepage mà những người này nhìn thấy sẽ là CTA đặt ở bottom-right\nNhóm B: 10,000 người ngẫu nhiên (tất nhiên khác với 10,000 người nhóm A) sẽ nhìn thấy CTA đặt ở bottom-left\n\nVà ta cần xác định CTR của phương án nào tốt hơn, hay là vị trí đặt nút “Mua Ngay” hoàn toàn không ảnh hưởng gì đến CTR.\n\n\n\n\nA (bottom-right)\nB (bottom-left)\n\n\n\n\nNumber of users\n10,000\n10,000\n\n\nCTR (Click through rate)\n??\n??\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Thu thập dữ liệu và phân tích\nMình chạy thí nghiệm kia trong khoảng 1 tháng và thu thập được dữ liệu.\nĐể ví dụ, thì mình sẽ dùng R để fake số:\n# nhóm A có 30 bản ghi, giá trị mean là 0.415 và sd là 0.05, phân phối chuẩn\na_group = rnorm(30, mean=0.415, sd=0.05)\n\n# nhóm B cũng có 30 bản ghi, giá trị mean là 0.45 và sd là 0.1, phân phối chuẩn\nb_group = rnorm(30, mean=0.45, sd=0.1)\nGiá trị trong 2 vectors trên có thể biểu diễn như ở bảng dưới:\n\n\n\nDate\nCTR from A (bottom-right)\nCTR from B (bottom-left)\n\n\n\n\n1/8/2020\n0.493\n0.262\n\n\n2/8/2020\n0.428\n0.408\n\n\n3/8/2020\n0.463\n0.35\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n29/8/2020\n0.452\n0.326\n\n\n30/8/2020\n0.389\n0.458\n\n\n\nĐể dễ hình dung ra dữ liệu này nó như thế nào, chúng ta sẽ visualize nó:\nbarplot(cbind(a_group, b_group), beside=TRUE)\n\n\n\nSo sánh CTR giữa 2 nhóm\n\n\nCó thể thấy, ngay từ việc “tạo” dữ liệu và đồ thị thì CTR của nhóm A phân tán ít hơn nhóm B (sd nhỏ hơn), nhưng giá trị trung bình cũng nhỏ hơn. Câu hỏi lúc này là dựa vào dữ liệu như trên thì có thể kết luận CTR trung bình của nhóm B tốt hơn của A không.\nBài toán được quy về câu hỏi hypothesis testing trong thống kê:\nWelch’s t-test để kiểm định 2 kỳ vọng \\(\\mu_1\\), \\(\\mu_2\\), ở đây 2 mẫu t-test là a_group và b_group và giả thuyết phương sai 2 mẫu này giống nhau là hợp lý vì…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBài viết đang được cập nhật…"

Yup, you can use Windows if you like, but I prefer Linux to learn programming.\nA lot of time\nAnd last but not least, a superior unbreakable persistent mind\n\nThere are 3 parts of this note:\n\nLearning Maths\nLearning Computer Science\nLearning Data Science\n\nMaths is basic stuff that support everything else, so I put it into an independent part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll 3 parts will only contain materials which I personally like and find them useful the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBold courses are must-taken or you should be familiar with the outcomes of those courses (so you don’t have to re-take it). Other courses are useful and good to learn."

    "text": "Computer Science\n\nBefore studying courses\nYou need to read a few books to understand the big pictures of computer science. Read these books in order:\n\n1. Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\nA great book that provides you the first sense of computer science — what is binary, how machine understand something like binary and more. I like how the authors represent the physics mechanism of computers, so if you are not so good at physics, this book is even better for you. This book is only 400 pages long, easy to read, therefore I highly recommend it as your first read when starting to learn CS.\n\n\n2. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)\nA legendary book. SICP is the kind of book that is recommended from everywhere in the CS world. It covers a lot of programming aspects from functional programming, abstraction, instruction processor to compilers. This might be quite hard for complete beginners and because this book uses the Scheme programming language, it’s pretty hard to read as well.\n\n\n\nCore Courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are many things not covered in this path yet (after completing CS61 series). If you want to discover other courses about security, networks, machine learning, look for them on the Internet or search in this awesome guide.\n\n\n\n1. CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science - Harvard\nLink: edX Course\nArguably the best intro course for CS I’ve ever learnt.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nBasic understanding of computer science and programming\nBasic algorithms and problem-solving thinking\nConcepts like abstraction, data structures, encapsulation, web development\nLanguages: Python, C, SQL, Javascript\n\n\n\n2. CS 61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Berkeley\nLink: Course Website\nA truly great course which makes me extremely eager to learn everything from Berkeley. However, to really enjoy it as well as get useful knowledge, you need to put a quite large amount of effort — definitely commit to do all the homeworks, assignments, and take all the exams. Might take you few months to actually get things done.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nPython and its implementation\nHigher-Order Functions, Recursion, Environment diagrams\nData Abstraction\nScheme, Exceptions, Iterators, Streams, SQL\n\n\n\n3. CS 61B Data Structures - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: datastructur.es\nThis one is quite hard for me because I don’t like learning Java much. But I think it’s useful if you want to learn data structures.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nBasic Java\nData structures: Lists, Abstract Classes, Trees, BST, Graphs\nAlgorithms: Sorting and Algorithmic Bounds\n\n\n\n4. CS 70 Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nI’ve not done this course yet. Discrete maths is cool and probability is interesting so I’ll finish this course soon.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nInduction and Recursion\nGraphs, Eulerian Tour\nModular Arithmetic\nPolynomials, Secret Sharing, Erasure Codes\nProbability: Counting, Sample Spaces, Events, Independence, Conditional Probability\nInference\n\n\n\n5. CS 61C Great Ideas in Computer Architecture - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nMy favorite one, because you will learn a lot about how machines work under the hood. Not digging too deep but quite good.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nC programming\nAssembly Language, MIPS Intro\n\n\n\n6. CS 162 Operating Systems and Systems Programming - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nA very tough course that I haven’t finished yet. More details about operating systems than CS61C.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nProcesses, Fork, I/O, Files\nThread, Scheduling, Address Translation, Caching\nPerformance, Storage Devices, Queueing theory\nDistributed Systems, TCP/IP\n\n\n\n7. CS164 Programming Languages and Compilers - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nI have not learned this course, but knowing about programming languages and compilers is surely useful for being a software engineer.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nUnit Calculator\nScoping and desugaring\nCoroutines and Lazy Iterators\nRegular expressions\nCYK and Earley Parsers\n\n\n\n8. CS169 Software Engineering - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nI have not learned this course, just read the syllabus and think it’s practical and useful.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nUnit Testing\nGit\nUML\nSoftware processes\nMVC, Web development\n\n\n\n\nStrengthen your knowledge\nI consider the 8 courses above as core courses that you should take seriously. After that, you now have a good understanding of computer science and are ready to improve yourself even more.\nThe first thing I want to dig into is programming languages.

    "text": "Acquiring data\nSomething I need to prepare:\n\nData Sources: facebook posts/groups, some websites as: nha.chotot.com, phongtro123.com, mogi.vn, batdongsan.com.vn\nFramework/Tools: For scrape data using Python, I will use Scrapy and Splash for simulate a browser in cases some website requires javascript. Row data will be stored in mongodb with ORM will be Pymongo; I also want to schedule the crawler thus I will use scrapy-do for scheduly running background tasks.\n\nLet’s code our “spider”.\nAfter creating folder for our project, setup virtualenv for python3, pip install scrapy to install scrapy, we run startproject command to create new project:\n$ scrapy startproject stacy\nThe crawler includes few main parts:\n\nThe spider itself: a class inherit scrapy.Spider class that create list of Requests that we send to get the webpage we need. Each Request has a callback that is the function which handle the response of the request.\nIn case we need authentication, we should care about middleware, I usually add cookies to middleware, so every requests the crawler makes will contains authentication information\nScrapy stores the data that retrive from response in Items. My item includes several fields but the most important is post_content that contains the raw text/content about housing.\nItem pipeline is where we save the Item to database.\nThe parsing part is usually quite boring, you can use inspector in browser to look up for the xpath or css of the element in DOM, then parsing is simple thing\n\nI will show some interesting parts in my code here.\n\nUsing splash with Lua script to login to a page\nSplash is a headless browser (a browser without GUI) that is integrated greatly with scrapy, the fun thing is Splash using Lua, so I need to learn a little about Lua to be able to write the automatically login script.\nfunction main(splash, args)\n    -- Define a function that focus on an input\n    function focus(sel)\n        splash:select(sel):focus()\n    end\n    \n    -- Go to the login site\n    assert(splash:go{\n        splash.args.url,\n        headers=splash.args.headers,\n        http_method=splash.args.http_method,\n        body=splash.args.body,\n    })\n    \n    -- \"Click\" to email input\n    focus('input[name=email]')\n    -- \"Type\" your email\n    splash:send_text(\"cuongtuanpham159@gmail.com\")\n    -- \"Click\" to password input\n    focus('input[name=pass]')\n    -- \"Type\" your password\n    splash:send_text(\"xtcc8JWyq2q/lxGX+4D9Sx92V80WttPhAJSBues\")\n    -- Wait a little bit to make sure inputs is filled\n    assert(splash:wait(0.5))\n    -- \"Click\" to Login button\n    splash:select('input[name=login]'):mouse_click()\n    -- Done, wait the welcome window to display\n    assert(splash:wait(2))                        \n                                                                \n    return {\n        url = splash:url(),\n        cookies = splash:get_cookies(), -- Get the cookies to store in database later\n        html = splash:html(),\n    }\nend\nThe code above is the most basic example when we want to login into some sites. Because in many cases, the website will require something like capcha, ‘I’m not robot’ thing and so on that make the login process more complicated. But normally I will successfully login to the website I want and get cookies that allows me to easily make requests later without having to login again.\n\n\nHandle middleware with cookies\nI’m not sure this is the good practice to add cookies to the requests, but I don’t know any other ways.\nmiddlewares.py\nclass StacyDownloaderMiddleware(object):\n    ...\n    def get_cookies(self, spider):\n        # Find cookies exists in db\n        return spider.collection.find_one({'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection})\n    \n    def process_request(self, request, spider):\n        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)\n        # If cookies exists, add cookies to request\n        if cookies:\n            request.cookies = cookies.get('cookies')\n        \n        return None\n    \n    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):\n        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)\n        # If in database has no coookies, insert to database, this applied when login\n        if not cookies:\n            spider.collection.insert_one({\n                'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection,\n                'cookies': response.data.get('cookies')\n            })\n\n        return response\nThe code above still need to be improved like add more validator when I check the cookies in the database, at least add the try except. But for small, simple project I do not focus on this yet.\n\n\nRemove all emoji or non-alphabet, non-vietnamese characters\nAfter we retrieve post_content from response html, we need briefly “clean” that data.\nExample I have retrieved a text:\n🏠🏠🏠 Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát ,sạch sẽ . Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ thoáng tầng 4 . Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt . 1,8 Tr/tháng, cọc 1 tháng . Ngõ :255 Nguyễn Khang-Cầu Giấy . Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH:0972413480\nThere are some things I noticed:\n\nEmoji and special characters in the text\nUppercase and lowercase characters\nExtra whitespace\n\nSo how to normalize the text above?\nUsing regex seems to be the fastest way to remove Emoji and unwanted characters.\nThe idea is replace all non-alphabet/vietnamese with empty string re.sub(r\"[^\\w\\s]+\", \"\", text) then replace double whitespace \\s\\s+ with single white space.\ndef clean_text(text):\n    return re.sub(r\"\\s\\s+\", \" \", re.sub(r\"[^\\w\\s]+\", \"\", text))\nWhen run the code above with the text above, result will be:\n\"Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát sạch sẽ Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ \nthoáng tầng 4 Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt 18 Trtháng cọc 1 tháng Ngõ 255 \nNguyễn KhangCầu Giấy Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH0972413480\"\nLook pretty … wrong. It’s will be hard for us to detect the price 18 Trtháng that actually is 1,8 Tr/tháng.\nBecause there are few punctuations that should be remained in the text like ,, ., /, therefore we need to define which ones ought to be kept.\nThe list of unicode characters could be found here. And thanks for that, I can define which punctuations I should remain in the text and rewrite my code:\ndef clean_text(text):\n    return re.sub(\n            r\"\\s\\s+\",\n            \" \",\n            re.sub(\n                r\"[^\\u002C-\\u002F\\u0028-\\u0029\\u003A-\\u003F\\w\\s]+\", \"\", text\n            )\n        )\nAnd the result is pretty good now:\n\"Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát ,sạch sẽ . \nCó chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ thoáng tầng 4 . \nChung chủ nên an ninh tốt . 1,8 Tr/tháng, cọc 1 tháng . \nNgõ :255 Nguyễn Khang-Cầu Giấy . Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH:0972413480\"\nWe can do more to remove redundant semicolons but I feel ok with this text and ready to save it to the data base.\nUpdating…"

    "text": "Layer 1: Universal SaaS Metrics\nNếu công ty SaaS là một cơ thể sống, thì MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) chính là nhịp tim. Nó cho biết cơ thể có đang sống khỏe mạnh, ổn định và bơm máu đều đặn hay không.\nKhác với các mô hình bán lẻ (E-commerce) nơi doanh thu trồi sụt theo mùa hoặc các đợt khuyến mãi, điểm quan trọng của SaaS nằm ở sự “Định kỳ” (Recurring).\n\n1. Định nghĩa chuẩn (The Definition)\nLà một Data Analyst, bạn cần phân biệt rạch ròi các khái niệm sau để tránh làm báo cáo sai lệch:\n\nMRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue): Tổng doanh thu dự kiến lặp lại hàng tháng từ tất cả khách hàng đang active.\nARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): Đơn giản là \\(MRR \\times 12\\). Chỉ số này thường dùng cho các công ty B2B Enterprise ký hợp đồng theo năm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning⚠️ Sai lầm “chết người” của Data Analyst\n\n\n\nMRR KHÔNG PHẢI là dòng tiền (Cash Flow) hay Doanh thu ghi nhận (GAAP Revenue).\nVí dụ: Nếu khách hàng trả trước 12 tháng (120 triệu VND) vào tháng 1: 1. Cash Flow (Tháng 1): 120 triệu. 2. GAAP Revenue (Tháng 1): 10 triệu (ghi nhận dần). 3. MRR (Tháng 1): 10 triệu.\n👉 Tại sao? MRR sinh ra để đo lường tốc độ tăng trưởng thực tế và quy mô của sản phẩm, không phải để đo lượng tiền mặt trong két sắt.\n\n\n\n\n2. Công thức tính & Cách xử lý dữ liệu\nLà một DA, bạn không tính thủ công bằng Excel. Bạn cần tư duy theo công thức toán học để viết SQL query.\n\nCông thức cơ bản\nTổng quát nhất, MRR được tính bằng tổng phí thuê bao của toàn bộ khách hàng đang hoạt động:\n\\[\nMRR = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\text{Active User}_i \\times \\text{Monthly Fee}_i)\n\\]\n\n\nThành phần của MRR (The MRR Equation)\nĐể trả lời câu hỏi “Tại sao tháng này MRR tăng/giảm?”, bạn cần tách MRR thành 4 dòng chảy (Components):\n\\[\nNet \\ New \\ MRR = (\\underbrace{New + Expansion}_{\\text{Growth}}) - (\\underbrace{Contraction + Churned}_{\\text{Loss}})\n\\]\nTrong đó: 1.
