Machine Structures - a must learned course in my opinion, maybe, because
I like to understand what happends under the hood in programming, and this
course provide exactly what I need.

However, this one is really tough. You will learn C, Assembly, and other 
stuff, besides I would like to learn *CS 162 Operating Systems 
and Systems Programming* as well.
