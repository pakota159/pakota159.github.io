*I'm just a man.*   
*Stand in front of the customers.*  
*Asking them to buy my product.*  
(From The movie Notting Hill 1999)

I studied **economics** at the university, then self-studied computer science, data science.

I love cheer people up by making product, especially software stuff. And I hope data analysis can help me understand the people better then make the better product.
