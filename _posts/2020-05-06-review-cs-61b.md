The most common way to execute a Java program is to run it through a sequence of two programs. The first is the Java compiler, or `javac`. The second is the Java interpreter, or `java`.

![java1]({{ page.java1 }}#post_img)

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

So variables in Java are strictly defined with a specific type. You can't change the type of variable after defining it.

`System.out.println` print to screen (like stdout), with \n at the end of line.  
`System.out.print` same as above but without \n.

Conditional statement similar as javascript.

**Data types**:
8 primitive types in Java:

1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double: stores approximations of real numbers
7. boolean
8. char

**reference type**

9. references to Objects

When you declare a variable of a certain type in Java:

- Your computer sets aside exactly enough bits to hold a thing of that type. Example: Declaring an int sets aside a “box” of 32 bits.
- Java creates an internal table that maps each variable name to a location
- Java does NOT write anything into the reserved boxes. - For safety, Java will not let access a variable that is uninitialized
  ![java2]({{ page.java2 }}#post_img)

**The Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE)**  
Given variables y and x:

- y = x copies all the bits from x into y.

![java3]({{ page.java3 }}#post_img)

![java4]({{ page.java4 }}#post_img)

![java5]({{ page.java5 }}#post_img)

![java6]({{ page.java6 }}#post_img)

![java7]({{ page.java7 }}#post_img)

**Use the private keyword to prevent code in other classes from using members (or constructors) of a class.**

**Function**

```java
public static int max(int x, int y) {
    if (x > y) {
        return x;
    }
    return y;
}
```

Same as in C, we declare function with name, type of output and parameters.

**ARRAY**

```java
int[] numbers = new int[3];
numbers[0] = 4;
numbers[1] = 7;
numbers[2] = 10;
// Or this way
int[] numbers = new int[]{4, 7, 10};
```

As above, we create new instance of class int named `numbers` which is array of 3 int.  
You can get the length of an array by using `.length`.

FOR LOOP syntax is similar as javascript.

`break` and `continue` similar as javascript. `Continue` skip the rest of the current iteration and jump to the next increment condition. `Break` terminates the innermost loop.

**Enhanced For Loop**

```java
String[] arr = ['x', 'y'];

for (String element: arr){
	System.out.println(element);
}
```

Basically, it's similar to `for in` in python.

**OOP**

```java
// This class can be run directly cause it has main() method. Similar idea as C
public class Otoke {
	public static void main() {

	}
}

// This class can't be run directly cause there is no main method
class Dog {
	// weight is a Instance variable
	public int weight;
	// Static method or variable like below can only be access by Class, not instance
	public static String TYPE = 'animal';

	// Constructor: (similar to a method, but not a method). Determines how to instantiate the class.
	public Dog(int initWeight){
		weight = initWeight;
	}

	// Non-static method, a.k.a. Instance Method
	// If the method needs to use "instance variables”, the method must be non-static.
	public void doubleWeigth() {
		System.out.println(weight * 2);
	}
}

public class Main {
	public static int main() {
		Dog smallDog;  // Declaration of a Dog variable.
		new Dog(20);  // Instantiation of the Dog class as a Dog Object / Dog instance
		smallDog = new Dog(5);  // Instantiation and Assignment.
		Dog hugeDog = new Dog(150);  // Declaration, Instantiation and Assignment
	}
}
```

**Static methods are invoked using the class name, e.g. Dog.makeNoise();**
**Instance methods are invoked using an instance name, e.g. maya.makeNoise();**
**Static methods can’t access “my” instance variables, because there is no “me”.**

```java
public static void main(String[] args)  // args is a array of command line arguments
// access item in array by args[index]
// args[0] mean first argument after name file.
```

**Nested Class**

```java
public class SLList {
	public class IntNode { // Define a class inside another
		public int item;
	}
	
	private IntNode stuff; // Use that to declare a new variable
}
```

Nested Classes are useful when a class doesn’t stand on its own and is obviously subordinate to another class.  
**Make the nested class private if other classes should never use the nested class.**

If the nested class never uses any instance variables or methods of the outer class, declare it static.  
Static classes cannot access outer class’s instance variables or methods.  
Results in a minor savings of memory.  

![java8]({{ page.java8 }}#post_img)

**Caching idea: putting aside data to speed up retrieval**  
So everytime we add new node to SSList, we +1 to size variable (which is an instance variable). Of course, when remove 1 node, -1 to size.

![java9]({{ page.java9 }}#post_img)

### SLList - Singly Linked List

Suppose we have a naked linked list (simply a node)
```java
public class IntNode {
	public int item;  // Item is the integer part of each node
	public IntNode next;  // next is a "pointer"/reference to the next node IntNode 

	public IntNode(int i, IntNode n){  // Initiation the node
		item = i;
		next = n;
	}
}
```
![java10]({{ page.java10 }}#post_img)

For better hanling with list, we can wrap the node above inside a Singly Linked List.
```java
public class SLList {
	private static class IntNode {
		private int item;
		private IntNode next;

		private IntNode(int i, IntNode n){
			item = i;
			next = n;
		}
	}
}
```
