Today, a friend asked me how to study computer science well - a popular question
that many others wonder too. Thus, I decided to write an **all-in-one
note** to explained detailed about learning computer science and data science as well.
I'm not excellent in computer science at all, and this note is only sharing some
experiences I have.

### Before you start
___
Knowing where you are is important. You need to understand how much cs knowledge
you have. This journey is long and exhausted but I can ensure it'll be fun as well, 
if you really like those stuff.

Prepare some things:
- A notebook and a pen to note and **visualize** important things 
while you learn such as how HTTP requests are sent and received, 
how CPU and RAM works, and so on. Visualization always helps you understand
things faster and easier. Examples: Some things I drew when learning about
CPU and RAM

- A laptop/computer with Linux/OSX operation system. Yup, you can use Window
if you like, but I prefer Linux to learn programming.

- A lot of time

- And last but not least, a superior unbreakable **persistent mind**

There are 3 parts of this note:
- Learning **Maths**

- Learning **Computer Science**

- Learning **Data Science**

Maths is basic stuff that support everything else, so I put it into an independent part.

> All 3 parts will only contains *materials* which I *personally* like and find them useful
the most.

> **Bold courses** are must-taken or you should be familiar with the outcomes of those courses (so you don't have to re-take it).  
Other courses are useful and good to learn.
