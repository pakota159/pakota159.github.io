There are many courses about data structures and algorithms out
there but only few of those that I enjoyed to learn.

**CS 61B Data Structures** of UC Berkeley, 
**CS 186 Introduction to Database Systems**
also from Berkeley are the first ones I found.
Then the three-course sequence 
**Introduction to Algorithms** to **Advanced Algorithms** from MIT.
And **COMP1927 Algorithms and Data Structures** of Professor 
Richard Buckland from UNSW.

I wish I have enough time and patient, persistence to learn all of those
courses. To be honest, I have only completed 1 of these above, the
*Introduction to Algorithms* from MIT.

Other than the courses above, **CSE373 (Analysis of Algorithms) course**
taught by Professor Steven Skiena is worth mentioned as well.
