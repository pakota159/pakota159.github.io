About 4 years ago, I encountered a huge struggle looking for a suitable room for rent. Information about renting house/room is vast and it's really hard to filter useful data.

I didn't want to hire an agent for that and didn't have time to search every websites for rent.

That's when I have the idea of collecting data automatically from every kind of websites.

But it took quite a long time to study programming well enough to make some tools like that. Few years later, now I'm able to make my wishes some true with the automation tools. I called it ***Stacy*** (in Gwen Stacy - A spider woman from Marvel)

There are normally 4 steps in defining and solving a data science problem:

1. Formulating a question or problem
2. Acquiring and cleaning data 
3. Conducting exploratory data analysis
4. Using prediction and inference to draw conclusions

For each step we need to answer some questions, so we go through these one by one.

## Define the question/problem we need to solve

*What do we want and what are our metrics of success or how to evaluate the result?*

In my case, I want:

- To find all houses that are **available at the time** and **satisfy my needs**.

Ex: I want a room with area around 20$m^2$, has windows, able to cook, inside Dong Da District and the price is around 2 million VND per month.

So to make sure the houses are *available at the time* and *satisfy my needs*, I need the tool to:

- Update in real-time or at least every 30 minutes which houses are available (*available at the time*)
- Match all the criteria (*satisfy my needs*)

I expect the data flow as below:

## Acquiring data

Something I need to prepare:

- **Data Sources**: facebook posts/groups, some websites as: *nha.chotot.com*, *phongtro123.com*, *mogi.vn*, *batdongsan.com.vn*

- **Framework/Tools**: For scrape data using Python, I will use **Scrapy** and **Splash** for simulate a browser in cases some website requires javascript. Row data will be stored in *mongodb* with ORM will be *Pymongo*; I also want to schedule the crawler thus I will use *scrapy-do* for scheduly running background tasks.

Let's code our "spider".

After creating folder for our project, setup *virtualenv* for python3, *pip install scrapy* to install scrapy, we run `startproject` command to create new project:

```bash
$ scrapy startproject stacy
```

The crawler includes few main parts:

- The spider itself: a class inherit `scrapy.Spider` class that create list of Requests that we send to get the webpage we need. Each `Request` has a callback that is the function which handle the response of the request.
- In case we need authentication, we should care about `middleware`, I usually add cookies to middleware, so every requests the crawler makes will contains authentication information
- Scrapy stores the data that retrive from `response` in `Items`. My item includes several fields but the most important is `post_content` that contains the raw text/content about housing.
- Item pipeline is where we save the Item to database.
- The parsing part is usually quite boring, you can use inspector in browser to look up for the `xpath` or `css` of the element in DOM, then parsing is simple thing

I will show some interesting parts in my code here.

### Using splash with Lua script to login to a page

Splash is a headless browser (a browser without GUI) that is integrated greatly with scrapy, the fun thing is Splash using Lua, so I need to learn a little about Lua to be able to write the automatically login script.

```lua
function main(splash, args)
    -- Define a function that focus on an input
    function focus(sel)
        splash:select(sel):focus()
    end
    
    -- Go to the login site
    assert(splash:go{
        splash.args.url,
        headers=splash.args.headers,
        http_method=splash.args.http_method,
        body=splash.args.body,
    })
    
    -- "Click" to email input
    focus('input[name=email]')
    -- "Type" your email
    splash:send_text("cuongtuanpham159@gmail.com")
    -- "Click" to password input
    focus('input[name=pass]')
    -- "Type" your password
    splash:send_text("xtcc8JWyq2q/lxGX+4D9Sx92V80WttPhAJSBues")
    -- Wait a little bit to make sure inputs is filled
    assert(splash:wait(0.5))
    -- "Click" to Login button
    splash:select('input[name=login]'):mouse_click()
    -- Done, wait the welcome window to display
    assert(splash:wait(2))                        
                                                                
    return {
        url = splash:url(),
        cookies = splash:get_cookies(), -- Get the cookies to store in database later
        html = splash:html(),
    }
end
```

The code above is the most basic example when we want to login into some sites. Because in many cases, the website will require something like capcha, 'I'm not robot' thing and so on that make the login process more complicated. But normally I will successfully login to the website I want and get `cookies` that allows me to easily make requests later without having to login again.

### Handle middleware with cookies

I'm not sure this is the good practice to add cookies to the requests, but I don't know any other ways.

`middlewares.py`

```python
class StacyDownloaderMiddleware(object):
    ...
    def get_cookies(self, spider):
        # Find cookies exists in db
        return spider.collection.find_one({'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection})
    
    def process_request(self, request, spider):
        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)
        # If cookies exists, add cookies to request
        if cookies:
            request.cookies = cookies.get('cookies')
        
        return None
    
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)
        # If in database has no coookies, insert to database, this applied when login
        if not cookies:
            spider.collection.insert_one({
                'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection,
                'cookies': response.data.get('cookies')
            })

        return response
```

The code above still need to be improved like add more validator when I check the cookies in the database, at least add the `try except`. But for small, simple project I do not focus on this yet.

### Remove all emoji or non-alphabet, non-vietnamese characters

After we retrieve `post_content` from response html, we need briefly "clean" that data.

Example I have retrieved a text:

`🏠🏠🏠 Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát ,sạch sẽ . Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ thoáng tầng 4 . Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt . 1,8 Tr/tháng, cọc 1 tháng . Ngõ :255 Nguyễn Khang-Cầu Giấy . Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH:0972413480`

There are some things I noticed:

- Emoji and special characters in the text
- Uppercase and lowercase characters
- Extra whitespace

So how to `normalize` the text above?

Using regex seems to be the fastest way to remove Emoji and unwanted characters.

The idea is replace all non-alphabet/vietnamese with empty string `re.sub(r"[^\w\s]+", "", text)` then replace double whitespace `\s\s+` with single white space.

```python
def clean_text(text):
    return re.sub(r"\s\s+", " ", re.sub(r"[^\w\s]+", "", text))
```

When run the code above with the text above, result will be:

```python
"Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát sạch sẽ Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ 
thoáng tầng 4 Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt 18 Trtháng cọc 1 tháng Ngõ 255 
Nguyễn KhangCầu Giấy Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH0972413480"
```

Look pretty ... wrong. It's will be hard for us to detect the price `18 Trtháng` that actually is `1,8 Tr/tháng`.

Because there are few punctuations that should be remained in the text like `,`, `.`, `/`, therefore we need to define which ones ought to be kept.

The list of unicode characters could be found [here](https://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character). And thanks for that, I can define which punctuations I should remain in the text and rewrite my code:

```python
def clean_text(text):
    return re.sub(
            r"\s\s+",
            " ",
            re.sub(
                r"[^\u002C-\u002F\u0028-\u0029\u003A-\u003F\w\s]+", "", text
            )
        )
```

And the result is pretty good now:

```python
"Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát ,sạch sẽ . 
Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ thoáng tầng 4 . 
Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt . 1,8 Tr/tháng, cọc 1 tháng . 
Ngõ :255 Nguyễn Khang-Cầu Giấy . Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH:0972413480"
```

We can do more to remove redundant semicolons but I feel ok with this text and ready to save it to the data base.
