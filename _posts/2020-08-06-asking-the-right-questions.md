I think the most important aspect in data analytic is asking the right questions. Sound obviously right? But how do we do that is itself a big question. So I dedicate this post for answering it with my limited knowledge.

Limitation: I only discuss the business questions only because that's my major field.

My resource:  
- Lean analytics book
- HN website
- Simplystatistics website

___
The first principle: the analysis needs to lead to an action. 

___
The main question:  
- behavioral analytics: understand customer behavior to support marketing, UX.
Example: give the behavior of the customers in the past 6 months, try to understand what they like, so you can target marketing to them better.

___
The above question is about customer behavior, we need to understand it, and it can be divided into 2 parts
- Understand the current/present patterns of user behavior which can be hidden (insights) or obvious.
- Predict the future behavior, usually as a results of the first part.

Case 1: When I heard about the entrance exam for university in Vietnam, I come up with a question, how likely the trending topic in vietnam in Literature related to the real question in the test. For example, if in the 3 months before the test, people talk a lot about 'Song - Xuan Quynh' how likely the real test will be 'Song - Xuan Quynh'.

I have a feeling/hypothesis that people will predict well about the real test, that means experienced teachers can give the well prediction and people will talk a lot about that topic before the test.

So to verify the hypothesis, I decide to do some data analysis.
