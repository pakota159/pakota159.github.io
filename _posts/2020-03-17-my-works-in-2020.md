### 1. Complete the game: The Box World  
Yup, this is the highest priority of all. The first ever product made entirely by me. I hope it could be an interesting game.

**Estimated Time: This Sunday 22/3/2020**

### 2. Finishing the course CS 61A Berkeley  
I really like this course, but arguably never have time to finish it. So, before jumping into new subjects, I would love to complete this one.  

At the same time, I also practicing Python (because the course above uses python as the primary language).

**Estimated Time: 25/3/2020**

### 3. Re-Learning about data structure and algorithm  
Once again, I never fully complete this stuff which I really like. So I decide to change that.
