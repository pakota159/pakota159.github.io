About 4 years ago, I encountered a huge struggle looking for a suitable room for rent.
Information about renting house/room is vast and it's really hard to filter useful data.

I didn't want to hire an agent for that and didn't have time to search
every websites for rent.

That's when I have the idea of collecting data automatically from every kind
of websites.

But it took quite a long time to study programming well enough to make some
tools like that. Few years later, now I'm able to make my wishes some true
with the automation tools. I called it *__Stacy__* (in Gwen Stacy - A spider woman from Marvel)

There are normally 4 steps in defining and solving a data science problem:
1. Formulating a question or problem
2. Acquiring and cleaning data 
3. Conducting exploratory data analysis
4. Using prediction and inference to draw conclusions

For each step we need to answer some questions, so we go throught these
one by one.

## Define the question/problem we need to solve
___
_What do we want and what are our metrics of success or how to evaluate the result?_

In my case, I want:
- To find all houses that are **available at the time** and **satisfy my needs**.

Ex: I want a room with area around 20$$m^2$$, has windows, able to cook, 
inside Dong Da District and the price is around 2 million VND per month.

So to make sure the houses are _available at the time_ and _satisfy my needs_, I need
the tool to:
- Update in real-time or at least every 30 minutes which houses are available (_available at the time_)
- Match all the criteria (_satisfy my needs_)

I expect the data flow as below:

![Scrape1]({{ page.scrape1 }}#post_img)

## Acquiring data
___
Something I need to prepare:
- **Data Sources**: facebook posts/groups, some websites as: *nha.chotot.com*, *phongtro123.com*,
*mogi.vn*, *batdongsan.com.vn*

- **Framework/Tools**: For scrape data using Python, I will use **Scrapy** and **Splash** for
simulate a browser in cases some website requires javascript. Row data will be stored in 
*mongodb* with ORM will be *Pymongo*; I also want to schedule the crawler thus I will use *scrapy-do*
for scheduly running background tasks.

Let's code our "spider".

After creating folder for our project, setup *virtualenv* for python3, *pip install scrapy*
to install scrapy  
we run `startproject` command to create new project
```bash
$ scrapy startproject stacy
```

The crawler includes few main parts:
- The spider itself: a class inherit `scrapy.Spider` class that create list of
Requests that we send to get the webpage we need.  
each `Request` has a callback that is the function which handle the response of
the request.
- In case we need authentication, we should care about `middleware`, I usually
add cookies to middleware, so every requests the crawler makes will contains 
authentication information
- Scrapy stores the data that retrive from `response` in `Items`. My item includes
several fields but the most important is `post_content` that contains the raw text/content
about housing.
- Item pipeline is where we save the Item to database.
- The parsing part is usually quite boring, you can use inspector in browser
to look up for the `xpath` or `css` of the element in DOM, then parsing is simple thing

I will show some interesting parts in my code here.

### Using splash with Lua script to login to a page
Splash is a headless browser (a browser without GUI) that is integrated greatly
with scrapy, the fun thing is Splash using Lua, so I need to learn a little about
Lua to be able to write the automatically login script.

```lua
    function main(splash, args)
        -- Define a function that focus on an input
        function focus(sel)
            splash:select(sel):focus()
        end
        
        -- Go to the login site
        assert(splash:go{
            splash.args.url,
            headers=splash.args.headers,
            http_method=splash.args.http_method,
            body=splash.args.body,
        })
        
        -- "Click" to email input
        focus('input[name=email]')
        -- "Type" your email
        splash:send_text("cuongtuanpham159@gmail.com")
        -- "Click" to password input
        focus('input[name=pass]')
        -- "Type" your password
        splash:send_text("xtcc8JWyq2q/lxGX+4D9Sx92V80WttPhAJSBues")
        -- Wait a little bit to make sure inputs is filled
        assert(splash:wait(0.5))
        -- "Click" to Login button
        splash:select('input[name=login]'):mouse_click()
        -- Done, wait the welcome window to display
        assert(splash:wait(2))                        
                                                                    
        return {
            url = splash:url(),
            cookies = splash:get_cookies(), -- Get the cookies to store in database later
            html = splash:html(),
        }
    end
```
The code above is the most basic example when we want to login into
some sites. Because in many cases, the website will require something like
capcha, 'I'm not robot' thing and so on that make the login process more
complicated. But normally I will successfully login to the website I want and
get `cookies` that allows me to easily make requests later without having to
login again.

### Handle middleware with cookies
I'm not sure this is the good practice to add cookies to the requests, but I don't
know any other ways.

`middlewares.py`
```python
class StacyDownloaderMiddleware(object):
    ...
    def get_cookies(self, spider):
        # Find cookies exists in db
        return spider.collection.find_one({'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection})
    
    def process_request(self, request, spider):
        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)
        # If cookies exists, add cookies to request
        if cookies:
            request.cookies = cookies.get('cookies')
        
        return None
    
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)
        # If in database has no coookies, insert to database, this applied when login
        if not cookies:
            spider.collection.insert_one({
                'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection,
                'cookies': response.data.get('cookies')
            })

        return response
```
The code above still need to be improved like add more validator when I check
the cookies in the database, at least add the `try except`. But for small, simple project
I do not focus on this yet.

### Remove all emoji or non-alphabet, non-vietnamese characters
After we retrieve `post_content` from response html, we need briefly "clean" that
data.

Example I have retrieved a text:  
`üè†üè†üè† Cho thu√™ ph√≤ng t·∫ßng 2 tho√°ng m√°t ,s·∫°ch s·∫Ω . C√≥ ch·ªó ƒëun n·∫•u v√† s√¢n ph∆°i ƒë·ªì tho√°ng 
t·∫ßng 4 . Chung ch·ªß n√™n an ninh t·ªët . 1,8 Tr/th√°ng, c·ªçc 1 th√°ng . Ng√µ :255 Nguy·ªÖn Khang-
C·∫ßu Gi·∫•y . B·∫°n n√†o qua t√¢m ib ho·∫∑c LH:0972413480`

There are some things I noticed:
- Emoji and special characters in the text
- Uppercase and lowercase characters
- Extra whitespace

So how to `normalize` the text above?

Using regex seems to be the fastest way to remove Emoji and unwanted characters

The idea is replace all non-alphabet/vietnamese with empty string `re.sub(r"[^\w\s]+", "", text)`
then replace double whitespace `\s\s+` with single white space.
```python
    def clean_text(text):
        return re.sub(r"\s\s+", " ", re.sub(r"[^\w\s]+", "", text))
```
When run the code above with the text above, result will be:
```python
"Cho thu√™ ph√≤ng t·∫ßng 2 tho√°ng m√°t s·∫°ch s·∫Ω C√≥ ch·ªó ƒëun n·∫•u v√† s√¢n ph∆°i ƒë·ªì 
tho√°ng t·∫ßng 4 Chung ch·ªß n√™n an ninh t·ªët 18 Trth√°ng c·ªçc 1 th√°ng Ng√µ 255 
Nguy·ªÖn KhangC·∫ßu Gi·∫•y B·∫°n n√†o qua t√¢m ib ho·∫∑c LH0972413480"
```
Look pretty ... wrong. It's will be hard for us to detect the price `18 Trth√°ng` that
actually is `1,8 Tr/th√°ng`

Because there are few punctuations that should be remained in the text like `,`, `.`, `/`  
therefore we need to define which ones ought to be kept.  
The list of unicode characters could be found [here](https://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character)   
And thanks for that, I can define which punctuations I should remain in the text and rewrite my code
```python
    def clean_text(text):
        return re.sub(
                r"\s\s+",
                " ",
                re.sub(
                    r"[^\u002C-u002F\u0028-u0029\u003A-u003F\w\s]+", "", text
                )
            )
```
And the result is pretty good now
```python
"Cho thu√™ ph√≤ng t·∫ßng 2 tho√°ng m√°t ,s·∫°ch s·∫Ω . 
C√≥ ch·ªó ƒëun n·∫•u v√† s√¢n ph∆°i ƒë·ªì tho√°ng t·∫ßng 4 . 
Chung ch·ªß n√™n an ninh t·ªët . 1,8 Tr/th√°ng, c·ªçc 1 th√°ng . 
Ng√µ :255 Nguy·ªÖn Khang-C·∫ßu Gi·∫•y . B·∫°n n√†o qua t√¢m ib ho·∫∑c LH:0972413480"
```
We can do more to remove redundant semicolons but I feel ok with this text and ready to 
save it to the data base.
