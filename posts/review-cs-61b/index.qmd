The most common way to execute a Java program is to run it through a sequence of two programs. The first is the Java compiler, or `javac`. The second is the Java interpreter, or `java`.

![Java compilation process](/img/review/java1.png)

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

Variables in Java are strictly defined with a specific type. You can't change the type of variable after defining it.

- `System.out.println` prints to screen (like stdout), with `\n` at the end of line
- `System.out.print` same as above but without `\n`

Conditional statements are similar to JavaScript.

## Data Types

### Primitive Types

There are 8 primitive types in Java:

1. `byte`
2. `short`
3. `int`
4. `long`
5. `float`
6. `double` — stores approximations of real numbers
7. `boolean`
8. `char`

### Reference Type

9. References to Objects

When you declare a variable of a certain type in Java:

- Your computer sets aside exactly enough bits to hold a thing of that type. Example: Declaring an `int` sets aside a "box" of 32 bits.
- Java creates an internal table that maps each variable name to a location.
- Java does NOT write anything into the reserved boxes — for safety, Java will not let you access a variable that is uninitialized.

## The Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE)

Given variables `y` and `x`:

> **y = x** copies all the bits from x into y.

::: {.callout-tip}
Use the `private` keyword to prevent code in other classes from using members (or constructors) of a class.

## Functions

```java
public static int max(int x, int y) {
    if (x > y) {
        return x;
    }
    return y;
}
```

Same as in C, we declare functions with name, type of output, and parameters.

## Arrays

```java
int[] numbers = new int[3];
numbers[0] = 4;
numbers[1] = 7;
numbers[2] = 10;

// Or this way
int[] numbers = new int[]{4, 7, 10};
```

We create a new instance of class `int` named `numbers` which is an array of 3 integers. You can get the length of an array by using `.length`.

### For Loop

`for` loop syntax is similar to JavaScript. `break` and `continue` work similarly as well:

- `continue` — skips the rest of the current iteration and jumps to the next increment condition
- `break` — terminates the innermost loop

### Enhanced For Loop

```java
String[] arr = {"x", "y"};

for (String element : arr) {
    System.out.println(element);
}
```

This is similar to `for in` in Python.

## Object-Oriented Programming

```java
// This class can be run directly because it has main() method
// Similar idea as C
public class Otoke {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}

// This class can't be run directly because there is no main method
class Dog {
    // weight is an Instance variable
    public int weight;
    
    // Static method or variable can only be accessed by Class, not instance
    public static String TYPE = "animal";

    // Constructor: (similar to a method, but not a method)
    // Determines how to instantiate the class
    public Dog(int initWeight) {
        weight = initWeight;
    }

    // Non-static method, a.k.a. Instance Method
    // If the method needs to use "instance variables", 
    // the method must be non-static
    public void doubleWeight() {
        System.out.println(weight * 2);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog smallDog;              // Declaration of a Dog variable
        new Dog(20);               // Instantiation of the Dog class
        smallDog = new Dog(5);     // Instantiation and Assignment
        Dog hugeDog = new Dog(150); // Declaration, Instantiation and Assignment
    }
}
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Static vs Instance Methods

- **Static methods** are invoked using the class name: `Dog.makeNoise();`
- **Instance methods** are invoked using an instance name: `maya.makeNoise();`
- **Static methods can't access instance variables**, because there is no "me"
:::

### Command Line Arguments

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
// args is an array of command line arguments
// access item in array by args[index]
// args[0] means first argument after filename
```

## Nested Classes

```java
public class SLList {
    public class IntNode {  // Define a class inside another
        public int item;
    }
    
    private IntNode stuff;  // Use that to declare a new variable
}
```

Nested Classes are useful when a class doesn't stand on its own and is obviously subordinate to another class.

::: {.callout-note}
## When to use nested classes

- **Make the nested class private** if other classes should never use the nested class
- **Declare it static** if the nested class never uses any instance variables or methods of the outer class
- Static classes cannot access outer class's instance variables or methods
- Results in a minor savings of memory

## Caching

**Caching idea**: putting aside data to speed up retrieval.

Every time we add a new node to SLList, we increment the `size` variable (which is an instance variable). When removing a node, we decrement it.

![Caching in SLList](/img/review/java9.png)

## SLList - Singly Linked List

Suppose we have a naked linked list (simply a node):

```java
public class IntNode {
    public int item;       // Item is the integer part of each node
    public IntNode next;   // next is a "pointer"/reference to the next IntNode 

    public IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {  // Initiation of the node
        item = i;
        next = n;
    }
}
```

![IntNode structure](/img/review/java10.png)

For better handling with lists, we can wrap the node above inside a Singly Linked List:

```java
public class SLList {
    private static class IntNode {
        private int item;
        private IntNode next;

        private IntNode(int i, IntNode n) {
            item = i;
            next = n;
        }
    }
}
```
