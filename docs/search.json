    "text": "Working with playlists\nNow it’s the fun part. How can I retrieve data of playlists I need?\nAfter reading the documents, I have a brief understand about what I can do with this api.\nThere are 3 ways to get info about playlists:\n\nUsing API /v1/users/{user_id}/playlists to acquire playlists of a specific user_id\nUsing API /v1/search to search and return playlists with a specific query keyword\nUsing API /v1/browse/categories/{category_id}/playlists to retrieve playlists from a specific category\n\nI want to use the third method, because the playlists I’m interested in should be distinguished by category instead of user, or query keywords.\nThere are many categories in spotify, and each category contains many playlists, each playlist has many tracks too. But I don’t want to get all playlists from each category, so I don’t have to call too many apis.\nThe expected output is something like this — for each category, I retrieve 5 playlists, and for each playlist, I want all tracks with its name, singer, and other data:\n[\n  {\n    \"category\": \"A\",\n    \"playlists\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"First playlist\",\n        \"tracks\": [\n          {\n            \"track_name\": \"Song 1\",\n            \"singer\": \"B\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nTo be able to manipulate data conveniently, I would like to save category, playlists, and tracks in database.\nI’ll use mongodb because it’s the most familiar database to me. You can use any of these.\nFirst, copy the access token in the login page above and assign it to new variable in app.js:\nvar acc_token = '&lt;your access token&gt;'\nThen install mongoose package:\nnpm install mongoose\nMongoose is a mongodb object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment or in this case, nodejs. Add mongoose:\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\n// Connect mongoose to our database named spotify.\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1/spotify', {useNewUrlParser: true});\n// useNewUrlParser to fix a DeprecationWarning\n\n// Declare schema\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;"

I can call it Category_Detail model. The advantage is whenever I want to retrieve data from db, I only have to access one model, no need to use reference fields.\nThe disadvantage is, as I considered, bigger because I will need to store my playlists in each Category_Detail as an array which makes thing hard to update, and with each playlist I need another array for tracks, so 2 nested arrays are too complicated for a model like this.\nThus, I decide to use the second way to design my model — 3 seperated models as following category, playlist and track. Playlist will contains 1 reference field that refers to category, and track will contains 1 reference field refers to playlist that it belongs to.\nconst CategorySchema = new Schema({\n  cat_name: String,\n  cat_id: String,\n});\nconst Category = mongoose.model('Category', CategorySchema);\n\nconst PlaylistSchema = new Schema({\n  category: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category'},\n  playlist_name: String,\n  playlist_id: String,\n});\nconst Playlist = mongoose.model('Playlist', PlaylistSchema);\n\nconst TrackSchema = new Schema({\n  playlist: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Playlist'},\n  track_name: String,\n  track_id: String,\n  artists: Array,\n  images: Array,\n  playlist_name: String,  // This field for convenient data analysis later\n  playlist_id: String,    // This field for convenient data analysis later\n});\nconst Track = mongoose.model('Track', TrackSchema);"

Nó cho biết cơ thể có đang sống khỏe mạnh, ổn định và bơm máu đều đặn hay không.\nKhác với các mô hình bán lẻ (E-commerce) nơi doanh thu trồi sụt theo mùa hoặc các đợt khuyến mãi, điểm quan trọng của SaaS nằm ở sự “Định kỳ” (Recurring).\n\n1. Định nghĩa chuẩn (The Definition)\nLà một Data Analyst, bạn cần phân biệt rạch ròi các khái niệm sau để tránh làm báo cáo sai lệch:\n\nMRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue): Tổng doanh thu dự kiến lặp lại hàng tháng từ tất cả khách hàng đang active. Bản chất của MRR là sự “Chuẩn hóa” (Normalization) doanh thu về đơn vị tháng.\nARR (Annual Recurring Revenue): Đơn giản là \\(MRR \\times 12\\). Chỉ số này thường dùng cho các công ty B2B Enterprise ký hợp đồng theo năm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning⚠️ Sai lầm “chết người” của Data Analyst\n\n\n\nMRR KHÔNG PHẢI là dòng tiền (Cash Flow) hay Doanh thu ghi nhận (GAAP Revenue).\nVí dụ: Nếu khách hàng trả trước 12 tháng (120 triệu VND) vào tháng 1:\n\nCash Flow (Tháng 1): 120 triệu (Tiền về túi ngay lập tức).\nGAAP Revenue (Tháng 1): 10 triệu (Ghi nhận dần theo nguyên tắc kế toán).\nMRR (Tháng 1): 10 triệu.\n\n👉 Tại sao? MRR sinh ra để đo lường tốc độ tăng trưởng thực tế và quy mô của sản phẩm (Momentum), không phải để đo lượng tiền mặt trong két sắt (Liquidity).\n\n\n\n\n2. Công thức tính & Cách xử lý dữ liệu (Technical Calculation)\nLà một DA, bạn không được cộng thô (Sum) số tiền trên hóa đơn. Bạn cần tư duy theo 2 bước: Normalization (Chuẩn hóa) và Aggregation (Tổng hợp).\n\nBước 1: Tính MRR cho từng khách hàng (Customer Level)\nTrước khi tính tổng, bạn phải đưa tất cả các gói cước về một mẫu số chung là “Tháng”. Theo The Ultimate SaaS Metrics Cheat Sheet:\n\\[\nMRR_{i} = \\frac{\\text{Contract Value}}{\\text{Billing Interval (Months)}} - \\text{One-time Fees}\n\\]\nVí dụ thực tế:\n\nKhách A mua gói tháng: Trả $50/tháng \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(MRR_A = 50\\).\nKhách B mua gói năm: Trả $1,200/năm \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(MRR_B = 1,200 / 12 = 100\\).\nKhách C mua gói quý: Trả $300/quý \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(MRR_C = 300 / 3 = 100\\).\n\n\n\nBước 2: Tổng hợp toàn hệ thống (Aggregation)\nSau khi chuẩn hóa, công thức tổng quát sẽ là:\n\\[\n\\text{Total MRR} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} MRR_{i}\n\\]\n\n\nBước 3: Phân tích biến động (The MRR Equation)\nĐể trả lời câu hỏi “Tại sao tháng này MRR tăng/giảm?”, bạn cần tách MRR thành 4 dòng chảy (Components):\nTrong đó:\n\nNew MRR: Từ khách hàng mới tinh (New Logos).\nExpansion MRR: Từ khách cũ nâng cấp gói (Upsell) hoặc mua thêm user (Cross-sell).\nContraction MRR: Khách cũ hạ cấp gói (Downgrade) hoặc gỡ bớt user.\nChurned MRR: Khách hàng hủy hoàn toàn dịch vụ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip📚 Tài liệu tham khảo uy tín (Reliable Sources)\n\n\n\nĐể hiểu sâu hơn về nuances (các sắc thái tinh tế) khi tính toán MRR/ARR, DA nên tham khảo các nguồn sau:\n\nSaaS Metrics 2.0 (David Skok): Được coi là “Kinh thánh” của ngành SaaS. Bài viết giải thích chi tiết tại sao MRR quan trọng hơn Cash Flow.\n\n👉 Read: SaaS Metrics 2.0 – A Guide to Measuring and Improving what Matters\n\nThe SaaS Metrics Cheat Sheet (ChartMogul): Tài liệu kỹ thuật cực tốt cho DA, định nghĩa rõ ràng về cách xử lý các trường hợp biên (edge cases) như discounts, refunds hay failed payments.\n\n👉 Read: The Ultimate SaaS Metrics Cheat Sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross Margin\nNếu MRR trả lời câu hỏi “Bạn bán được bao nhiêu?”, thì Gross Margin (Biên lợi nhuận gộp) trả lời câu hỏi “Chất lượng doanh thu của bạn tốt đến mức nào?”.\nTrong giới đầu tư, $1 doanh thu của công ty SaaS (Margin 80%) có giá trị gấp 3-4 lần so với $1 doanh thu của công ty Agency/Dịch vụ (Margin 30%). Đây là chỉ số phân định rạch ròi giữa “Công ty công nghệ thực thụ” và “Công ty chạy bằng cơm”.\n\n1. Định nghĩa chuẩn & COGS trong SaaS\nGross Margin là phần doanh thu còn lại sau khi trừ đi COGS (Cost of Goods Sold - Giá vốn hàng bán).\nVới một Data Analyst, thách thức lớn nhất nằm ở việc xác định: Cái gì được tính là COGS trong SaaS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning⚠️ Checklist: COGS bao gồm những gì?\n\n\n\nKhông giống như bán lẻ (nhập hàng/tồn kho), COGS của SaaS bao gồm các chi phí trực tiếp để duy trì dịch vụ cho khách hàng:\n\n☁️ Hosting Costs: Chi phí máy chủ (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).\n🎧 Customer Support: Lương của đội ngũ Support/Success (Lưu ý: Không bao gồm đội Sales).\n🔗 Third-party Fees: Phí bản quyền phần mềm nhúng (ví dụ: phí API bản đồ, phí SMS gateway, phí cổng thanh toán).\n👷 DevOps/Site Reliability: Chi phí nhân sự duy trì hệ thống vận hành (Maintenance).\n\nLưu ý: Chi phí phát triển sản phẩm (R&D) và chi phí bán hàng (S&M) KHÔNG nằm trong COGS.\n\n\n\n\n2. Công thức tính (The Formula)\n\\[\n\\text{Gross Margin \\%} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue} - \\text{COGS}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nVí dụ: Bạn thu về $100. Bạn tốn $10 cho server AWS và \\(10 trả lương đội Support.\\)$ Lợi nhuận gộp là $80. Gross Margin = 80%.\n\n\n3. Benchmarks: Thước đo “Đẳng cấp”\nGross Margin chính là phong vũ biểu để phân loại mô hình kinh doanh của bạn.\n\n&gt; 80% (Pure SaaS): Đẳng cấp thế giới (Salesforce, Slack, Zoom). Doanh thu tăng nhưng chi phí không tăng tương ứng (Scalability cao).\n\n60% - 80% (Average SaaS): Mức chấp nhận được. Thường gặp ở các SaaS có yếu tố phức tạp hoặc cần support nhiều.\n\n&lt; 50% (SaaS-enabled Service): Báo động. Có thể bạn đang làm mô hình dịch vụ trá hình SaaS (ví dụ: bán phần mềm nhưng phải cử người xuống cài đặt, đào tạo, làm hộ báo cáo). Khả năng mở rộng (Scale) rất kém.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💡 Tại sao Gross Margin thấp lại “giết chết” Valuation?\n\n\n\nHãy nhìn vào công thức LTV ở phần sau: \\[LTV = \\frac{ARPU \\times \\mathbf{Gross Margin \\%}}{Churn}\\]\nMargin giảm từ 80% xuống 40% nghĩa là LTV của bạn giảm một nửa. Để bù đắp, bạn phải chi ít tiền hơn cho Marketing (CAC), dẫn đến tăng trưởng chậm lại. Đó là một vòng xoáy đi xuống.\n\n\n\n\n4. Tối ưu hóa Gross Margin (Analyst Actionable)\nLà DA, bạn có thể giúp cải thiện chỉ số này bằng cách phân tích:\n* Unit Cost Analysis: Chi phí AWS trên mỗi khách hàng là bao nhiêu? Có khách hàng nào “bào” server quá mức so với số tiền họ trả không?\n* Support Efficiency: Tỷ lệ ticket/khách hàng. Nếu một tính năng gây lỗi liên tục khiến đội Support quá tải, Margin sẽ bị ăn mòn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip📚 Tài liệu tham khảo uy tín (Reliable Sources)\n\n\n\nĐể chuẩn hóa cách hạch toán COGS cho SaaS, hãy tham khảo:\n\nWhat to Include in COGS for SaaS (The SaaS CFO): Hướng dẫn chi tiết về kế toán quản trị để tách bạch chi phí R&D và COGS.\n\n👉 Read: SaaS P&L: What goes in Cost of Goods Sold?\n\nSaaS Gross Margin Benchmarks (OpenView): Dữ liệu khảo sát từ hàng trăm công ty để biết bạn đang đứng ở đâu trên thị trường.\n\n👉 Read: 2023 SaaS Benchmarks Report\n\nThe Impact of Gross Margin (Kellblog): Phân tích của Dave Kellogg về việc tại sao các nhà đầu tư lại ghét Margin thấp (liên quan đến hệ số nhân doanh thu).\n\n👉 Read: Why Gross Margins Matter in SaaS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLTV, CAC, CAC Payback\nNếu MRR cho biết quy mô hiện tại, thì cặp chỉ số LTV (Lifetime Value) và CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) cho biết tính khả thi (Viability) của mô hình kinh doanh trong dài hạn. Đây được gọi là Unit Economics (Kinh tế đơn vị).\nHiểu đơn giản: Bạn bỏ ra bao nhiêu tiền để mua một khách (CAC) và khách đó sẽ trả lại cho bạn bao nhiêu tiền lãi trước khi họ rời đi (LTV).\n\n1. CAC: Chi phí để có một khách hàng (Customer Acquisition Cost)\nĐịnh nghĩa: CAC là tổng chi phí Sales & Marketing cần thiết để thuyết phục một khách hàng mới (New Customer) mua hàng trong một khoảng thời gian nhất định.\n\nCông thức tính (The Formula)\n\\[\nCAC = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Total Sales \\& Marketing Expenses})}{\\text{Number of New Customers Acquired}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning⚠️ Sai lầm thường gặp: “Invisible Costs”\n\n\n\nNhiều Data Analyst chỉ tính tiền chạy quảng cáo (Ad Spend) vào tử số. Đây là sai lầm nghiêm trọng làm chỉ số đẹp giả tạo. Theo chuẩn HubSpot và SaaS Metrics 2.0, chi phí Sales & Marketing phải bao gồm:\n\n💰 Ad Spend: Tiền trả cho Facebook, Google, LinkedIn.\n👥 Salaries: Lương + Thưởng + Hoa hồng (Commissions) của toàn bộ đội Sales & Marketing.\n🛠️ Tools & Tech: Chi phí phần mềm (CRM, Marketing Automation, Zoom…).\n🎨 Creative/Content: Chi phí sản xuất nội dung, design, event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. LTV: Giá trị trọn đời khách hàng (Customer Lifetime Value)\nĐịnh nghĩa: LTV là tổng lợi nhuận gộp (Gross Profit) mà bạn dự kiến thu được từ một khách hàng trong suốt vòng đời của họ.\nĐiểm mấu chốt: LTV là một chỉ số mang tính dự báo (Predictive), không phải chỉ là lịch sử.\n\nCông thức tính (The Formula)\nTheo David Skok, công thức LTV chuẩn xác nhất phải bao gồm Gross Margin (Biên lợi nhuận gộp). Nếu bỏ qua Gross Margin, bạn đang tính Doanh thu (Revenue) chứ không phải Giá trị (Value).\n\\[\nLTV = \\frac{ARPU \\times \\text{Gross Margin \\%}}{\\text{Churn Rate}}\n\\]\nTrong đó:\n* ARPU: Doanh thu trung bình trên một khách hàng (Average Revenue Per User).\n* Gross Margin %: Tỷ lệ lãi gộp (thường là 70-80% với SaaS).\n* Churn Rate: Tỷ lệ khách hàng rời bỏ hàng tháng.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🧮 Ví dụ thực tế (The Math)\n\n\n\n\nKhách trả: $100 / tháng (ARPU).\nChi phí server/support: $20 / tháng \\(\\rightarrow\\) Gross Margin = 80%.\nTỷ lệ rời bỏ (Churn): 5% / tháng (Trung bình khách ở lại 20 tháng).\n\n\\[\nLTV = \\frac{100 \\times 0.8}{0.05} = \\$1,600\n\\] Nghĩa là: Mỗi khách hàng mang về $1,600 tiền lãi gộp trong suốt vòng đời của họ.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The Golden Ratio: LTV:CAC\nChỉ số LTV hay CAC đứng một mình không có nhiều ý nghĩa. Sức mạnh nằm ở tỷ lệ của chúng.\n\nBenchmark tiêu chuẩn (The 3:1 Rule)\n\\[\n\\text{Target Ratio} = \\frac{LTV}{CAC} \\geq 3\n\\]\n\n&lt; 1:1 (Thảm họa): Bạn tốn tiền mua khách nhiều hơn tiền khách trả lại. Càng bán càng lỗ.\n&lt; 3:1 (Nguy hiểm): Hiệu quả thấp, dòng tiền yếu, khó mở rộng quy mô.\n= 3:1 (Lý tưởng): Doanh nghiệp khỏe mạnh.\n&gt; 5:1 (Cẩn trọng): Có thể bạn đang đầu tư quá ít vào Marketing. Bạn đang bỏ lỡ cơ hội chiếm lĩnh thị trường (Under-spending).\n\n\n\nCAC Payback Period (Thời gian hoàn vốn)\nBên cạnh tỷ lệ 3:1, thời gian thu hồi vốn quan trọng hơn đối với dòng tiền (Cash Flow).\n\\[\n\\text{Months to Recover CAC} = \\frac{CAC}{MRR \\times \\text{Gross Margin \\%}}\n\\]\n\nTarget: &lt; 12 tháng. (Tốt nhất là 6-9 tháng). Nếu quá 12 tháng, startup sẽ gặp rủi ro lớn về vốn lưu động.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip📚 Tài liệu tham khảo uy tín (Reliable Sources)\n\n\n\nNội dung trên được tổng hợp dựa trên các nguyên tắc Unit Economics từ các nguồn sau:\n\nSaaS Economics - The LTV:CAC Ratio (David Skok): Bài viết gốc định nghĩa tầm quan trọng của Gross Margin trong công thức LTV.\n\n👉 Read: Startup Killer: the Cost of Customer Acquisition\n\nLTV Calculation Guide (ProfitWell): Phân tích các sai lầm khi tính LTV (như nhầm lẫn giữa Linear LTV và Geometric LTV).\n\n👉 Read: How to Calculate LTV for SaaS\n\nCAC Benchmarks (HubSpot): Cung cấp cái nhìn chi tiết về các thành phần chi phí ẩn trong CAC.\n\n👉 Read: The Ultimate Guide to Customer Acquisition Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Revenue Retention (NRR) & Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)\nNếu MRR là tốc độ hiện tại, thì Retention (Tỷ lệ giữ chân) dự báo tương lai. Trong mô hình Subscription, việc giữ khách hàng (Retention) quan trọng hơn việc kiếm khách mới (Acquisition) gấp nhiều lần.\nCó hai lăng kính để nhìn vào khả năng giữ chân dòng tiền: GRR (Phòng thủ) và NRR (Tấn công).\n\n1. Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) - Chỉ số “Phòng thủ”\nĐịnh nghĩa: GRR đo lường phần doanh thu bạn giữ lại được từ tập khách hàng cũ trong một kỳ, không bao gồm doanh thu bán thêm (Expansion/Upsell).\nĐặc điểm nhận dạng:\n* GRR luôn luôn \\(\\le\\) 100%.\n* GRR cho biết thực lực cốt lõi của sản phẩm: Liệu sản phẩm có đủ tốt để khách không rời đi không?\n\nCông thức tính (The Formula)\n\\[\nGRR = \\frac{\\text{MRR Start} - (\\text{Churn} + \\text{Contraction})}{\\text{MRR Start}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nTrong đó:\n* Churn: Doanh thu mất đi do khách hủy dịch vụ.\n* Contraction: Doanh thu mất đi do khách hạ cấp gói.\n* MRR Start: Doanh thu đầu kỳ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📉 Tại sao GRR quan trọng?\n\n\n\nNếu GRR thấp (ví dụ &lt; 80%), nghĩa là “cái xô bị thủng đáy” (Leaky Bucket). Dù bạn có Sales giỏi đến đâu (NRR cao), nhưng nếu GRR thấp, bạn vẫn đang mất máu từ cốt lõi. Không thể Upsell cho một khách hàng đang muốn rời đi.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) - Chỉ số “Tấn công”\nĐịnh nghĩa: NRR đo lường tổng doanh thu giữ lại được từ khách cũ, bao gồm cả doanh thu mở rộng (Expansion) từ Upsell/Cross-sell.\nĐặc điểm nhận dạng:\n* NRR có thể &gt; 100%.\n* Khi NRR &gt; 100%, doanh nghiệp đạt trạng thái Negative Churn (Churn âm). Tức là ngay cả khi không có khách mới, công ty vẫn tăng trưởng doanh thu.\n\nCông thức tính (The Formula)\n\\[\nNRR = \\frac{(\\text{MRR Start} + \\text{Expansion}) - (\\text{Churn} + \\text{Contraction})}{\\text{MRR Start}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip🎯 Benchmark: What is Good?\n\n\n\nTheo khảo sát từ Lenny’s Newsletter và ChartMogul:\n\nGRR:\n\nGood: 85% - 90%.\nGreat (Enterprise): &gt; 90%.\n\nNRR:\n\nSMB SaaS: ~100% (Khó upsell vì budget khách nhỏ).\nMid-Market: 110% - 120%.\nEnterprise (Snowflake, Datadog): &gt; 120% (Thậm chí 150%). Đây là lý do định giá của họ cao ngất ngưởng.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Phân tích so sánh: NRR vs. GRR (The Gap Analysis)\nLà một Data Analyst, bạn không được nhìn hai chỉ số này độc lập. Hãy nhìn vào khoảng cách (Gap) giữa chúng.\n\\[\n\\text{Expansion Impact} = NRR - GRR\n\\]\n\nKịch bản 1: NRR cao (120%) nhưng GRR thấp (70%).\n\nInsight: Bạn đang dùng kỹ năng Upsell tuyệt vời để che giấu một sản phẩm tồi (khách bỏ đi nhiều nhưng khách ở lại gánh team). Đây là tăng trưởng không bền vững.\n\nKịch bản 2: NRR thấp (90%) và GRR cao (90%).\n\nInsight: Sản phẩm cực tốt, khách trung thành, nhưng bạn dở tệ trong việc kiếm thêm tiền từ họ (Pricing strategy kém hoặc thiếu tính năng Upsell).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📚 Tài liệu tham khảo uy tín (Reliable Sources)\n\n\n\nĐể hiểu sâu về chiến lược tối ưu Retention, hãy tham khảo:\n\nRetention Benchmarks (Lenny’s Newsletter): Tổng hợp benchmark chi tiết nhất về NRR/GRR theo từng phân khúc khách hàng (B2C, B2B SMB, Enterprise).\n\n👉 Read: What is a good retention rate?\n\nSaaS Retention Metrics Guide (ChartMogul): Hướng dẫn kỹ thuật về cách tính toán và sự khác biệt giữa User Retention và Revenue Retention.\n\n👉 Read: The Ultimate Guide to SaaS Retention Metrics\n\nNegative Churn (David Skok): Giải thích tại sao Negative Churn (NRR &gt; 100%) là chén thánh của mô hình SaaS.\n\n👉 Read: Why Churn is Critical to Success in SaaS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule of 40\nNếu các chỉ số trên đi sâu vào chi tiết, thì Rule of 40 là thước đo tổng quát (High-level Health Check) được các nhà đầu tư (VC) sử dụng để đánh giá nhanh sức khỏe của một công ty SaaS trưởng thành.\nNó trả lời câu hỏi cốt tử: “Công ty này đang đốt tiền để tăng trưởng (Growth) hay đang tối ưu lợi nhuận (Profitability)? Và sự đánh đổi đó có xứng đáng không?”\n\n1. Nguyên lý hoạt động (The Principle)\nQuy tắc này phát biểu rằng: Tổng của Tốc độ tăng trưởng doanh thu và Biên lợi nhuận của một công ty SaaS khỏe mạnh phải lớn hơn hoặc bằng 40%.\n\\[\n\\text{Growth Rate \\%} + \\text{Profit Margin \\%} \\ge 40\\%\n\\]\nNguyên lý này cho phép sự linh hoạt tuyệt vời:\n* Nếu bạn tăng trưởng cực nhanh (100%), bạn có thể chấp nhận lỗ nặng (-60%). (Tổng = 40%).\n* Nếu bạn tăng trưởng chậm (10%), bạn buộc phải có lãi cao (30%). (Tổng = 40%).\n\n\n2. Công thức tính & Sắc thái dữ liệu (Nuances)\nLà một Data Analyst, bạn cần định nghĩa rõ “Growth” là gì và “Profit” là gì trong công thức này.\n\nCông thức chuẩn (The Standard Formula)\n\\[\nR40 = \\text{YoY ARR Growth} + \\text{EBITDA Margin}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote💡 Data Analyst Note: EBITDA vs. FCF\n\n\n\nTrong khi các Finance Manager thường dùng EBITDA (Lợi nhuận trước thuế, lãi vay, khấu hao) để tính Profit, thì các nhà đầu tư công nghệ khó tính (Tech Investors) lại thích dùng Free Cash Flow (FCF) Margin.\nTại sao? Vì dòng tiền (FCF) là sự thật, còn EBITDA có thể bị “xào nấu” bởi các thủ thuật kế toán. Nếu sếp bạn yêu cầu sự trung thực tuyệt đối, hãy dùng FCF.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Phân tích các kịch bản (Scenario Analysis)\nKhông phải cứ cộng lại là xong. Bạn cần đặt công ty vào đúng ngữ cảnh của nó trên biểu đồ:\n\nThe Rocket Ship (Tăng trưởng nóng):\n\nGrowth: 80%. Profit: -30%. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Total: 50% (&gt;40).\nĐánh giá: Tốt. Các nhà đầu tư sẵn sàng chấp nhận lỗ để chiếm thị phần (Land Grab).\n\nThe Cash Cow (Con bò sữa):\n\nGrowth: 10%. Profit: 35%. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Total: 45% (&gt;40).\nĐánh giá: Tốt. Công ty đã trưởng thành, tập trung vào tối ưu hóa lợi nhuận và cổ tức.\n\nThe Zombie (Xác sống):\n\nGrowth: 15%. Profit: 5%. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Total: 20% (&lt;40).\nĐánh giá: Nguy hiểm. Tăng trưởng không đủ nhanh để gọi vốn, nhưng lợi nhuận không đủ nhiều để tự nuôi sống. Đây là vùng chết (Dead Zone).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning⚠️ Khi nào KHÔNG áp dụng Rule of 40?\n\n\n\nĐừng áp dụng quy tắc này cho Early-stage Startups (dưới $1M ARR). Giai đoạn đầu, các startup thường có Margin cực thấp (-100% đến -200%) và Growth cực cao (300%). Cộng hai số này lại ra kết quả rất nhiễu (Volatile). Ngưỡng áp dụng: Thường khi công ty đạt &gt;$1M ARR (hoặc chuẩn hơn là &gt;$5M ARR).\n\n\n\n\n4. Biến thể mới: Rule of X (The New Standard)\nGần đây (2023-2024), trong bối cảnh thị trường vốn khó khăn, các quỹ đầu tư như Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP) cho rằng Rule of 40 đã lỗi thời. Họ đề xuất Rule of X, trong đó định giá Growth cao hơn Profit.\nCông thức (tham khảo): \\[\n\\text{Rule of X} = (Multiplier \\times \\text{Growth}) + \\text{Profit}\n\\] Thường Multiplier nằm trong khoảng 2x - 3x, nhấn mạnh rằng tăng trưởng doanh thu vẫn là vua trong SaaS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip📚 Tài liệu tham khảo uy tín (Reliable Sources)\n\n\n\n\nThe Rule of 40 for a Healthy SaaS Company (Brad Feld): Bài viết gốc năm 2015 từ người đã “khai sinh” ra khái niệm này.\n\n👉 Read: The Rule of 40% For a Healthy SaaS Company\n\nSaaS Rule of 40 Benchmark (Bain & Company): Báo cáo chi tiết về cách các công ty công nghệ áp dụng và duy trì Rule of 40 qua các năm.\n\n👉 Read: Hacking the SaaS Rule of 40\n\nIntroducing the Rule of X (Bessemer Venture Partners): Cập nhật tư duy mới nhất về định giá SaaS 2024.\n\n👉 Read: State of the Cloud 2024 - Rule of X"

    "section": "Acquiring data",
    "text": "Acquiring data\nSomething I need to prepare:\n\nData Sources: facebook posts/groups, some websites as: nha.chotot.com, phongtro123.com, mogi.vn, batdongsan.com.vn\nFramework/Tools: For scrape data using Python, I will use Scrapy and Splash for simulate a browser in cases some website requires javascript. Row data will be stored in mongodb with ORM will be Pymongo; I also want to schedule the crawler thus I will use scrapy-do for scheduly running background tasks.\n\nLet’s code our “spider”.\nAfter creating folder for our project, setup virtualenv for python3, pip install scrapy to install scrapy, we run startproject command to create new project:\n$ scrapy startproject stacy\nThe crawler includes few main parts:\n\nThe spider itself: a class inherit scrapy.Spider class that create list of Requests that we send to get the webpage we need. Each Request has a callback that is the function which handle the response of the request.\nIn case we need authentication, we should care about middleware, I usually add cookies to middleware, so every requests the crawler makes will contains authentication information\nScrapy stores the data that retrive from response in Items. My item includes several fields but the most important is post_content that contains the raw text/content about housing.\nItem pipeline is where we save the Item to database.\nThe parsing part is usually quite boring, you can use inspector in browser to look up for the xpath or css of the element in DOM, then parsing is simple thing\n\nI will show some interesting parts in my code here.\n\nUsing splash with Lua script to login to a page\nSplash is a headless browser (a browser without GUI) that is integrated greatly with scrapy, the fun thing is Splash using Lua, so I need to learn a little about Lua to be able to write the automatically login script.\nfunction main(splash, args)\n    -- Define a function that focus on an input\n    function focus(sel)\n        splash:select(sel):focus()\n    end\n    \n    -- Go to the login site\n    assert(splash:go{\n        splash.args.url,\n        headers=splash.args.headers,\n        http_method=splash.args.http_method,\n        body=splash.args.body,\n    })\n    \n    -- \"Click\" to email input\n    focus('input[name=email]')\n    -- \"Type\" your email\n    splash:send_text(\"cuongtuanpham159@gmail.com\")\n    -- \"Click\" to password input\n    focus('input[name=pass]')\n    -- \"Type\" your password\n    splash:send_text(\"xtcc8JWyq2q/lxGX+4D9Sx92V80WttPhAJSBues\")\n    -- Wait a little bit to make sure inputs is filled\n    assert(splash:wait(0.5))\n    -- \"Click\" to Login button\n    splash:select('input[name=login]'):mouse_click()\n    -- Done, wait the welcome window to display\n    assert(splash:wait(2))                        \n                                                                \n    return {\n        url = splash:url(),\n        cookies = splash:get_cookies(), -- Get the cookies to store in database later\n        html = splash:html(),\n    }\nend\nThe code above is the most basic example when we want to login into some sites. Because in many cases, the website will require something like capcha, ‘I’m not robot’ thing and so on that make the login process more complicated. But normally I will successfully login to the website I want and get cookies that allows me to easily make requests later without having to login again.\n\n\nHandle middleware with cookies\nI’m not sure this is the good practice to add cookies to the requests, but I don’t know any other ways.\nmiddlewares.py\nclass StacyDownloaderMiddleware(object):\n    ...\n    def get_cookies(self, spider):\n        # Find cookies exists in db\n        return spider.collection.find_one({'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection})\n    \n    def process_request(self, request, spider):\n        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)\n        # If cookies exists, add cookies to request\n        if cookies:\n            request.cookies = cookies.get('cookies')\n        \n        return None\n    \n    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):\n        cookies = self.get_cookies(spider=spider)\n        # If in database has no coookies, insert to database, this applied when login\n        if not cookies:\n            spider.collection.insert_one({\n                'spider_name': spider.cookie_collection,\n                'cookies': response.data.get('cookies')\n            })\n\n        return response\nThe code above still need to be improved like add more validator when I check the cookies in the database, at least add the try except. But for small, simple project I do not focus on this yet.\n\n\nRemove all emoji or non-alphabet, non-vietnamese characters\nAfter we retrieve post_content from response html, we need briefly “clean” that data.\nExample I have retrieved a text:\n🏠🏠🏠 Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát ,sạch sẽ . Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ thoáng tầng 4 . Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt . 1,8 Tr/tháng, cọc 1 tháng . Ngõ :255 Nguyễn Khang-Cầu Giấy . Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH:0972413480\nThere are some things I noticed:\n\nEmoji and special characters in the text\nUppercase and lowercase characters\nExtra whitespace\n\nSo how to normalize the text above?\nUsing regex seems to be the fastest way to remove Emoji and unwanted characters.\nThe idea is replace all non-alphabet/vietnamese with empty string re.sub(r\"[^\\w\\s]+\", \"\", text) then replace double whitespace \\s\\s+ with single white space.\ndef clean_text(text):\n    return re.sub(r\"\\s\\s+\", \" \", re.sub(r\"[^\\w\\s]+\", \"\", text))\nWhen run the code above with the text above, result will be:\n\"Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát sạch sẽ Có chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ \nthoáng tầng 4 Chung chủ nên an ninh tốt 18 Trtháng cọc 1 tháng Ngõ 255 \nNguyễn KhangCầu Giấy Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH0972413480\"\nLook pretty … wrong. It’s will be hard for us to detect the price 18 Trtháng that actually is 1,8 Tr/tháng.\nBecause there are few punctuations that should be remained in the text like ,, ., /, therefore we need to define which ones ought to be kept.\nThe list of unicode characters could be found here. And thanks for that, I can define which punctuations I should remain in the text and rewrite my code:\ndef clean_text(text):\n    return re.sub(\n            r\"\\s\\s+\",\n            \" \",\n            re.sub(\n                r\"[^\\u002C-\\u002F\\u0028-\\u0029\\u003A-\\u003F\\w\\s]+\", \"\", text\n            )\n        )\nAnd the result is pretty good now:\n\"Cho thuê phòng tầng 2 thoáng mát ,sạch sẽ . \nCó chỗ đun nấu và sân phơi đồ thoáng tầng 4 . \nChung chủ nên an ninh tốt . 1,8 Tr/tháng, cọc 1 tháng . \nNgõ :255 Nguyễn Khang-Cầu Giấy . Bạn nào qua tâm ib hoặc LH:0972413480\"\nWe can do more to remove redundant semicolons but I feel ok with this text and ready to save it to the data base.\nUpdating…"

Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\nA great book that provides you the first sense of computer science — what is binary, how machine understand something like binary and more. I like how the authors represent the physics mechanism of computers, so if you are not so good at physics, this book is even better for you. This book is only 400 pages long, easy to read, therefore I highly recommend it as your first read when starting to learn CS.\n\n\n2. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)\nA legendary book. SICP is the kind of book that is recommended from everywhere in the CS world. It covers a lot of programming aspects from functional programming, abstraction, instruction processor to compilers. This might be quite hard for complete beginners and because this book uses the Scheme programming language, it’s pretty hard to read as well.\n\n\n\nCore Courses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere are many things not covered in this path yet (after completing CS61 series). If you want to discover other courses about security, networks, machine learning, look for them on the Internet or search in this awesome guide.\n\n\n\n1. CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science - Harvard\nLink: edX Course\nArguably the best intro course for CS I’ve ever learnt.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nBasic understanding of computer science and programming\nBasic algorithms and problem-solving thinking\nConcepts like abstraction, data structures, encapsulation, web development\nLanguages: Python, C, SQL, Javascript\n\n\n\n2. CS 61A Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Berkeley\nLink: Course Website\nA truly great course which makes me extremely eager to learn everything from Berkeley. However, to really enjoy it as well as get useful knowledge, you need to put a quite large amount of effort — definitely commit to do all the homeworks, assignments, and take all the exams. Might take you few months to actually get things done.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nPython and its implementation\nHigher-Order Functions, Recursion, Environment diagrams\nData Abstraction\nScheme, Exceptions, Iterators, Streams, SQL\n\n\n\n3. CS 61B Data Structures - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: datastructur.es\nThis one is quite hard for me because I don’t like learning Java much. But I think it’s useful if you want to learn data structures.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nBasic Java\nData structures: Lists, Abstract Classes, Trees, BST, Graphs\nAlgorithms: Sorting and Algorithmic Bounds\n\n\n\n4. CS 70 Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nI’ve not done this course yet. Discrete maths is cool and probability is interesting so I’ll finish this course soon.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nInduction and Recursion\nGraphs, Eulerian Tour\nModular Arithmetic\nPolynomials, Secret Sharing, Erasure Codes\nProbability: Counting, Sample Spaces, Events, Independence, Conditional Probability\nInference\n\n\n\n5. CS 61C Great Ideas in Computer Architecture - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nMy favorite one, because you will learn a lot about how machines work under the hood. Not digging too deep but quite good.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nC programming\nAssembly Language, MIPS Intro\n\n\n\n6. CS 162 Operating Systems and Systems Programming - Berkeley\nVideos: InfoCoBuild\nCourse: Course Website\nA very tough course that I haven’t finished yet. More details about operating systems than CS61C.\nWhat you can learn:\n\nProcesses, Fork, I/O, Files\nThread, Scheduling, Address Translation, Caching\nPerformance, Storage Devices, Queueing theory\nDistributed Systems, TCP/IP\n\n\n\n7.

    "text": "Phân tích bài toán\nGiả sử, bạn đang là cô-founder (hoặc chú-founder) của 1 start-up nào đó. Sản phẩm của bạn tốt nhưng bạn muốn cải thiện UI-UX của nó để nó có thể tốt hơn.\nMuốn làm cho sản phẩm tốt hơn, thì bạn phải biết nó đang không tốt ở chỗ nào đã.\nĐể cho cụ thể, mình sẽ thử phân tích 1 phần UI/UX trang homepage của Lazada. Các phân tích phía sau đều là giả thuyết và mang tính minh hoạ cho ý tưởng.\n\n1. Từ dữ liệu xác định chỉ số cần cải thiện (xác định mục tiêu)\nTrong trang homepage có rất nhiều phần/section khác nhau, và mình sẽ thử tính toán số liệu ở section đầu tiên — cái banner ở homepage này.\n\n\n\nBanner homepage Lazada\n\n\nGiả sử, bạn vào trong data warehouse của công ty và query ra 2 thông số là lượt view banner và lượt click banner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsection\nview_count\nclick_count\nclick_rate (click_count / view_count)\n\n\n\n\nbanner\n150,000\n750\n0.5%\n\n\n\nTất nhiên, số kia mình bịa ra nên nó hơi cực đoan 1 chút. Ta biết CTR của 1 banner quảng cáo dạng slider là khoảng 1% (mình lấy số từ 1 nghiên cứu của đại học Notre Dame — Link tại đây, số này cũng chỉ mang tính tham khảo vì mình không biết số phù hợp trong trường hợp này).\nVì vậy, tỷ lệ click 0.5% ở trên là thấp và do đó mục tiêu là cần tìm cách sửa banner để cải thiện click rate của banner.\n\n\n2. Dựa vào kinh nghiệm cá nhân hoặc Heuristic Evaluation để xác định vấn đề\nGiờ thì ta cần phân tích xem cái banner đang có vấn đề gì.\nTheo mình thì banner đã được:\n\nThiết kế đẹp\nMàu sắc hài hoà\nNội dung liên quan đến dịp trung thu sắp tới\nKhuyến mãi cũng rõ ràng\n\nTuy nhiên có 1 phần mà tớ cảm thấy hơi có vấn đề là nút CTA (Call-to-Action) Mua Ngay.\nLiệu nút CTA có nên đặt ở phần giữa phía dưới (bottom-center) của banner sẽ ổn hơn; hay là ngay dưới dòng khuyến mãi “Sắp sửa chơi trăng” (bottom-left) và chuyển cái hashtag sang bên phải — vì mình cảm thấy người dùng sẽ dễ click vào CTA hơn nếu nó ở giữa hoặc ở ngay phía bên trái (do mắt người sẽ đọc từ trái sang phải); hoặc là chả cần cái nút này nữa.\n\n\n\nPhân tích vị trí CTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSau tất cả, đó chỉ là suy đoán cảm tính của mình, và mình cần 1 căn cứ đáng tin cậy hơn để quyết định vị trí đặt CTA.\n\n\n\n\n3. Thử nghiệm\nNhư vậy, mình đã đưa ra 1 số phán đoán và giờ mình cần thử nghiệm để xem phán đoán nào chính xác. Mình sẽ thử nghiệm với 2 vị trí CTA là bottom-left và bottom-right (những giải pháp khác cũng làm tương tự).\nMình chọn mẫu người dùng với số lượng 10,000 người dùng cho mỗi vị trí:\n\nNhóm A: 10,000 người dùng ngẫu nhiên và banner homepage mà những người này nhìn thấy sẽ là CTA đặt ở bottom-right\nNhóm B: 10,000 người ngẫu nhiên (tất nhiên khác với 10,000 người nhóm A) sẽ nhìn thấy CTA đặt ở bottom-left\n\nVà ta cần xác định CTR của phương án nào tốt hơn, hay là vị trí đặt nút “Mua Ngay” hoàn toàn không ảnh hưởng gì đến CTR.\n\n\n\n\nA (bottom-right)\nB (bottom-left)\n\n\n\n\nNumber of users\n10,000\n10,000\n\n\nCTR (Click through rate)\n??\n??\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Thu thập dữ liệu và phân tích\nMình chạy thí nghiệm kia trong khoảng 1 tháng và thu thập được dữ liệu.\nĐể ví dụ, thì mình sẽ dùng R để fake số:\n# nhóm A có 30 bản ghi, giá trị mean là 0.415 và sd là 0.05, phân phối chuẩn\na_group = rnorm(30, mean=0.415, sd=0.05)\n\n# nhóm B cũng có 30 bản ghi, giá trị mean là 0.45 và sd là 0.1, phân phối chuẩn\nb_group = rnorm(30, mean=0.45, sd=0.1)\nGiá trị trong 2 vectors trên có thể biểu diễn như ở bảng dưới:\n\n\n\nDate\nCTR from A (bottom-right)\nCTR from B (bottom-left)\n\n\n\n\n1/8/2020\n0.493\n0.262\n\n\n2/8/2020\n0.428\n0.408\n\n\n3/8/2020\n0.463\n0.35\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n29/8/2020\n0.452\n0.326\n\n\n30/8/2020\n0.389\n0.458\n\n\n\nĐể dễ hình dung ra dữ liệu này nó như thế nào, chúng ta sẽ visualize nó:\nbarplot(cbind(a_group, b_group), beside=TRUE)\n\n\n\nSo sánh CTR giữa 2 nhóm\n\n\nCó thể thấy, ngay từ việc “tạo” dữ liệu và đồ thị thì CTR của nhóm A phân tán ít hơn nhóm B (sd nhỏ hơn), nhưng giá trị trung bình cũng nhỏ hơn. Câu hỏi lúc này là dựa vào dữ liệu như trên thì có thể kết luận CTR trung bình của nhóm B tốt hơn của A không.\nBài toán được quy về câu hỏi hypothesis testing trong thống kê:\nWelch’s t-test để kiểm định 2 kỳ vọng \\(\\mu_1\\), \\(\\mu_2\\), ở đây 2 mẫu t-test là a_group và b_group và giả thuyết phương sai 2 mẫu này giống nhau là hợp lý vì…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBài viết đang được cập nhật…"

Similarly, on Jan 26, there were another 1,358 new users who signed up.\nThe triangle heat map shows us how those user groups behave. In the first row, the group of 1,098 users who registered on Jan 25 stopped using the app the next day (Jan 26) dramatically — dropping by 66.1% and remaining at only 33.9%. The following day, it got worse when only 23.5% of those 1,098 users were still using the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey Insight\n\n\n\nThanks to the heat map, we can see that after the first day of registration, most groups of users are leaving the app. This answers the question of when our customers leave our platform.\nThe next question is: how do we investigate that first day of using the app to define why they stop using it?"

Retention có thể là Repurchase Rate - tỷ lệ lặp lại hành vi mua hàng của người dùng, hoặc Churn Rate - tỷ lệ người dùng rời bỏ nền tảng của bạn. Điểm chung của các chỉ số về Retention là bạn sẽ theo dõi 1 nhóm người dùng xác định (1 cohort) và đánh giá xem nhóm người này tiếp tục sử dụng hay rời bỏ nền tảng của bạn như thế nào trong 1 khoảng thời gian nhất định.\nConversion: tỷ lệ chuyển đổi. Đây là những chỉ số liên quan đến khả năng chuyển đổi khách hàng từ bước A đến bước B trong luồng người dùng của bạn. Nó có thể là tỷ lệ chuyển đổi của các kênh marketing, hoặc của từng bước trong luồng của web/app.\nCost: chi phí. Chi phí ở đây có thể là chi phí để tìm kiếm 1 khách hàng (CAC - Customer acquisition cost) hoặc chi phí trên từng đơn hàng (Cost per Order). Về cơ bản, nó là chi phí mà bạn phải bỏ ra trên 1 đơn vị, bạn cần biết thông số này để so sánh nó với giá trị bạn mang lại, và từ đó đánh giá được mô hình của bạn đang hoạt động có mang lại lợi nhuận hay không.\nRevenue: doanh thu. Có chi phí thì tất nhiên phải quan tâm đến doanh thu. Revenue ở đây cũng tính trên 1 đơn vị, có thể là Customer Lifetime Value - CLV cho ta biết 1 khách hàng sẽ mang lại bao nhiêu doanh thu trong suốt vòng đời sử dụng. Hoặc có thể tính Average order value, giá trị đơn hàng trung bình để biết trung bình 1 đơn hàng, bạn sẽ có doanh thu bao nhiêu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTrong mỗi nhóm chỉ số trên, mình sẽ chỉ lấy ra 1 chỉ số mà mình cảm thấy quan trọng và cần thiết nhất, tuỳ trường hợp mô hình kinh doanh của bạn, chỉ số bạn quan tâm có thể sẽ khác."

Sau đó, khi đã có 1 số lượng khách hàng trung thành nhất định, sẽ là trạng thái Hybrid, vừa chăm sóc khách hàng cũ, vừa duy trì các chương trình thu hút khách mới (như những chương trình khuyến mãi cho người dùng mới trên Shopee, Tiki, Lazada, …). Cuối cùng, khi nền tảng của bạn trở nên khổng lồ như Amazon, bạn sẽ tập trung cho chương trình Loyalty.\n\nVí dụ tính RR\nTrong database của bạn có 1 bảng thống kê đơn hàng như sau:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norder_id\nusername\norder_completed_at\nfirst_order_at\n30_days_since_first\nis_30day_RR\n\n\n\n\n71\nCuong\n2020-07-06 10:23:54\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-05\nfalse\n\n\n72\nLong\n2020-07-08 11:24:35\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-07\nfalse\n\n\n73\nHoang\n2020-07-27 11:25:35\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-26\nfalse\n\n\n101\nCuong\n2020-08-02 10:23:54\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-05\ntrue\n\n\n102\nHoang\n2020-08-25 11:22:35\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-26\ntrue\n\n\n103\nCuong\n2020-09-09 04:20:54\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-05\nfalse\n\n\n104\nLong\n2020-09-09 14:22:35\nJuly 2020\n2020-08-07\nfalse\n\n\n\nBảng trên đã được xử lý để cho chúng ta có thể xác định được cohort — 1 tập khách hàng có chung 1 hành vi xác định. Ở đây là những khách hàng có đơn hàng đầu tiên vào tháng 7 năm 2020. Nói cách khác, đó là những khách hàng mới mà chúng ta kiếm được trong tháng 7, và ghi nhận tất cả các đơn hàng thành công của họ từ lúc bắt đầu (tháng 7) cho đến hiện tại.\nTrong số những khách hàng này (3 người), chỉ có 2 người thực hiện 1 đơn hàng khác trong vòng 30 ngày kể từ ngày đầu tiên mua hàng. Để xác định điều đó, chỉ cần so sánh order_completed_at với 30_days_since_first, nếu nhỏ hơn thì đó là 1 đơn hàng được thực hiện trong vòng 30 ngày từ ngày đầu tiên mua.\nNhư vậy, ta có thể nói 30-day repurchase rate hay 30 days RR là:\n\\[\\text{30 days RR} = \\frac{2}{3} = 66.6\\%\\]\nTương tự, ta có thể tính 15, 30, 90 days RR — tỷ lệ khách hàng mua lại trong 15, 30 hay 90 ngày, tuỳ vào từng trường hợp kinh doanh cụ thể của bạn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRR là 1 tỷ lệ phụ thuộc vào 2 khoảng thời gian, như trường hợp trên là 30 days RR của tháng 7. Nếu bạn tính cho các tháng khác, hoặc cohort của 1 khoảng thời gian khác (tuần, quý, năm, …) thì kết quả sẽ ra khác.\n\n\nTỷ lệ này cho chúng ta biết tỷ lệ khách hàng vẫn còn trung thành với sản phẩm của mình:\n\nTrên 30%: nền tảng đang ở trạng thái Loyalty\n15% đến 30%: trạng thái Hybrid\nDưới 15%: trạng thái Acquisition"

Normally we’ll search one by one from left to right of the list: 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 6. We found it, but if the list has thousands of items, it would take a lot of time to do the search operation like that.\nAlternatively, we can use a binary search tree data structure to improve the speed. We basically arrange the order of the items in the list with the rule:\n\nEach item is stored in a node\nEach node (item) may have left and right child with the condition: left child &lt; item &lt; right child\n\n\n\n\nBinary Search Tree\n\n\nWith that logic, we don’t have to go through all items to find the number we want.\nStart from root (top item). If we want number 6, we compare it with the root node. 6 &lt; 7 so we go to the left branch (because smaller items are always stored to the left of the parent item). We get number 4 and because 6 &gt; 4 we go to the right of 4.\nThe time to search/find an item only depends on the height of the tree, which is the longest path from root node to any leaf node (other items) in the tree. The bigger the height, the slower the speed to find the item we want.\n\n\n\nTree Height"

In this case, smaller means it comes before in the alphabet.\n\n\n\nIndex B-tree Structure\n\n\nWhen we search for a name like Yehuda Katz, we start from the root. Y is bigger than P in Paul Bakaus so we look up the right node of Paul Bakaus.\nIn the child node, we do the same thing until we reach the lowest child node. In this lowest node, we do binary search to search the value. The number of values stored in each node is small, so binary search will do the search really fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy We Use B-tree\n\n\n\n\nWe can store data in each node instead of only 1 in a balanced tree, therefore reducing the height of the tree and improving the speed of the search.\nValues in each node are sorted in a particular order, therefore we can look up faster. The number of values in each node is small enough so binary search can be quick too."

    "text": "Rules for SQL Optimization\nThanks to understanding the underlying principle of indexes, we can now note down some rules for better queries in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe notes below will be updated regularly.\n\n\n\n1. Avoid LIKE with Leading Wildcards\nAvoid LIKE expressions with leading wildcards (e.g., '%TERM').\nBecause the index uses the first letter and sorts by A-Z order, we should avoid LIKE expressions without the first letter specified. The index table will be useless in this case.\n\n\n2. Multi-Column Index Rules\nIf we create an index for multiple columns, then the WHERE condition applied for only one of those columns will not use the index.\nFor example, if we make an index for user_id and company, then searching for user_id = 1000 alone will not use the index. The index is only valid for the combination of user_id and company. We have to search for user_id = 1000 AND company = 'GOOGLE' to use the index.\n\n\n3. Case-Insensitive Indexes\nIf we want to search with Case-Insensitive matching (meaning CUONG and Cuong return the same result), then we should create an index with case-insensitivity:\nCREATE INDEX user_index ON users (UPPER(first_name));\nThis creates an index with uppercase of first_name column values. Then we execute the query:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE UPPER(first_name) = 'CUONG';\n\n\n4. Function-Based Index Considerations\nIf you want to query data like “how many days from the latest day each user bought a product”, you might write something like TRUNC(DAYS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, buy_date)).\nHowever, this value cannot be indexed because it changes daily. (Index can be updated with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands, but can’t automatically update daily or when executing SELECT commands).\nSolution: Index buy_date instead. If we want to query all users that have 30 days from now to their latest purchase, we calculate that date (that_date = today - 30 days), then query with condition that_date = buy_date.\n\n\n5. DateTime Range Conditions\nWhen writing conditions for datetime ranges, explicitly declare the start and end of the time range.\nInstead of:\nWHERE date_time &lt; '2020-10-10'\nWrite:\nWHERE date_time &gt; '2020-10-09' AND date_time &lt; '2020-10-10'"
